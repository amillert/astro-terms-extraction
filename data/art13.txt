Abstract
In controlling transmission of COVID-19, the effectiveness of border quarantine strategies is a key
concern for jurisdictions in which the local prevalence of disease and immunity is low. In settings like this
such as China, Australia, and New Zealand, rare outbreak events can lead to escalating epidemics and
trigger the imposition of large scale lockdown policies. Here, we examine to what degree vaccination
status of incoming arrivals and the quarantine workforce can allow relaxation of quarantine requirements.
To do so, we develop and apply a detailed model of COVID-19 disease progression and transmission
taking into account nuanced timing factors. Key among these are disease incubation periods and the
progression of infection detectability during incubation. Using the disease characteristics associated
with the ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2 to benchmark the level of acceptable risk, we examine the
performance of the border quarantine system for vaccinated arrivals. We examine disease transmission
and vaccine efficacy parameters over a wide range, covering plausible values for the Delta variant
currently circulating globally. Our results indicate a threshold in outbreak potential as a function of
vaccine efficacy, with the time until an outbreak increasing by up to two orders of magnitude as vaccine
efficacy against transmission increases from 70% to 90%. For parameters corresponding to the Delta
variant, vaccination is able to maintain the capacity of quarantine systems to reduce case importation
and outbreak risk, by counteracting the pathogen’s increased infectiousness. To prevent outbreaks,
heightened vaccination in border quarantine systems must be combined with mass vaccination. The
ultimate success of these programs will depend sensitively on the efficacy of vaccines against viral
transmission.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mitigation of pandemics requires a continuous analysis of risk trade-offs in order to respond
proportionately and efficiently. Border quarantine systems are designed to allow travel between
jurisdictions while limiting the risk of disease transmission between them. Rigorously limiting
disease transmission between regions is appropriate when large differences exist in pathogen
prevalence. While strict border measures are effective at preventing disease incursions, they are
also costly to operate and reduce international travel to a trickle. Given the enormous economic
and social costs associated with the international travel restrictions that come with stringent
border quarantine policies, such systems should only be used when they can prevent a catastrophic
2
public health crisis [1, 2].
During the COVID-19 pandemic, border quarantine strategies have been implemented in most
parts of the world in various forms [3, 4]. In regions with tightly controlled borders, screening
of international travellers has provided an effective means of limiting the importation rate of
individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 [5–7]. This has facilitated the success of outbreak control
strategies relying on targeted test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) responses. This combination
of approaches has been largely successful in preventing widespread epidemics of COVID-19 in
countries such as China, New Zealand, and Australia [8–11]. In Australia, this has meant that
many citizens abroad at the outset of the pandemic have been stranded overseas due to quarantine
capacity constraints. It has also stressed the higher education and tourism sectors and devastated
the airline industry [12–14]. The design of a quarantine system needs to balance the benefits
of reducing the risk of importation against the associated costs. In order to assess this tradeoff, analytical frameworks must incorporate emerging evidence about pathogen characteristics to
provide accurate estimates of the risk associated with alternative quarantine strategies.
Two potential factors motivating a revaluation of quarantine stringency include changes in the
properties of a pathogen, and changes in what is deemed an acceptable level of breach risk. In
the case of COVID-19, the development and rollout of effective vaccines provided an opportunity
for countries that had previously maintained stringent border controls to contemplate a future in
which these measures could be relaxed.
However, the emergence of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has produced the need to evaluate
risk trade-offs in the context of a virus exhibiting higher transmissibility, higher clinical severity,
and against which existing vaccines are less effective [15–22]. In this shifting context, the role
of vaccination and the acceptable risk of border quarantine breach events must be re-evaluated.
The emergence of new variants with broadly different disease characteristics can be viewed as the
onset of a new pandemic. Therefore, risk trade-offs and mitigation measures need to be assessed
based on up-to-date information. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of border quarantine
systems as a function of the following pathogen characteristics:
• transmissibility
• efficacy of vaccines against transmission (the combination of efficacy against infection, and
efficacy against transmission from breakthrough cases)
3
As our primary purpose is to estimate reduction in transmission risk, we focus on pathogen
and vaccine characteristics associated with transmission. The efficacy of vaccines for preventing
infection and onward transmission is a primary consideration when designing modified border
quarantine pathways for vaccinated travellers, which is currently becoming a widely adopted
framework [23].
We evaluate the performance of a simulated border quarantine system consistent with the
recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) for countries that choose to quarantine all international arrivals [24]. This includes a 14-day minimum stay, a testing regime, and
a response strategy that isolates confirmed cases and their contacts from the other travellers in
quarantine (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The chosen model reproduces general features adopted by
the Chinese, Australian, and New Zealand border quarantine systems.
We examine the performance of the quarantine system over a range of vaccine efficacy levels
and reproductive ratios, relative to an unvaccinated baseline condition (0% vaccine efficacy).
We then investigate how the risk of outbreaks seeded by quarantine breach events changes with
the emergence of a more transmissible strain (i.e., the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2). For
our outbreak scenarios, we examine the effect of varying levels of population-wide vaccination
coverage. This model, and the ensemble of results presented here can help guide adaptation
of border quarantine measures as the virus evolves, vaccination coverage increases, and vaccine
efficacy changes.
II. METHODS
A. Model overview (structure, inputs, outputs)
We simulate virus transmission, case detection, and isolation response pathways within a
single quarantine facility with a capacity of 100 travellers. The facility is staffed by 20 vaccinated
workers who have intermittent contact with those in quarantine. Individuals are processed subject
to testing and case isolation. The structure of the quarantine environment is generic, but captures
the main principles typically applied in border quarantine facilities. The output of the quarantine
model is used in a separate branching process model to evaluate the potential for outbreaks of
community transmission. A schematic of the overall system is shown in Figure 1.
The population is structured in two distinct groups, one of these comprising workers who staff

FIG. 1. Schematic of the quarantine system model. Arrivals enter quarantine in groups of four
close contacts. These groups are in weak contact with one another and with the workforce. If a case
is detected, the infected individual is placed into 10-day isolation, and their contacts are placed
into a 14-day quarantine extension. Travellers in extended quarantine are still in contact with the
workforce and with other close-contact groups within the facility. A separate branching process
model is used to evaluate the potential for outbreaks in the community based on the breach event
statistics produced by the quarantine system model.
the facility, and the other comprising the quarantined travellers. Travellers move through the
system as indicated in Figure 2. After arriving in close contact groups of 4 individuals, travellers
remain in the system for 14 days unless an infection is detected within their group. The 14 day
minimum stay means that, typically, 50 travellers exit the system each week.
The model used to simulate border quarantine incorporates a detailed description of COVID-19
progression and transmission that captures the following salient features:
• A lognormally distributed incubation period (mean approx. 5.5 d [µ = 1.62, σ = 0.418],
Figure S8)
• Time-varying infectiousness, increasing from the moment of exposure, peaking just before
symptom onset, and declining until recovery (Figure S4)
5
• Time-varying RT-PCR test sensitivity with a peak before symptom onset followed by a
gradual decline (Figure S6)
• An over-dispersed secondary case distribution (Figure S2)
These features allow the model to capture two important effects of the quarantine environment.
The first of these is the truncation of the naturally over-dispersed secondary case distribution due
to physical separation of close contact groups. The second is the tendency for false negative tests
to occur during the early stages of infection. Detailed descriptions of disease natural history and
test sensitivity models can be found in the Supporting Information.
Detection of infection can occur due either to positive RT-PCR tests (conducted on days
3 and 12), or symptom onset. The model assumes that 1/3 of all cases are asymptomatic.
Asymptomatic cases can only be detected through testing. Symptomatic cases may be detected
during the pre-symptomatic period through RT-PCR. If not, they are detected at the end of their
incubation period, when they begin expressing symptoms (all symptomatic individuals are treated
as confirmed cases).
Case detection in travellers results in a 10-day isolation period for the case, as well as a 14-day
quarantine extension for close contacts with additional tests on days 3 and 12 of the extension
period. Subsequent detection within the same group of contacts results in isolation of cases,
but does not incur additional extensions for remaining contacts. Therefore, the maximum period
for which an individual can remain in the system is 38 days. This would occur if an individual
were the close contact of a case detected on day 14 of the initial stay, were detected as a case
themselves on the 14th day of their extension period, and were subsequently isolated for 10
additional days. While in quarantine extension, transmission dynamics are not altered. While in
isolation, individuals may not transmit infection to any other individuals. When all members of a
close contact group are discharged from the system, they are replaced by a new group.
In a simulated quarantine facility, the workforce is composed of 20 individuals who come and
go each day. Workers are tested via RT-PCR on each day they attend the site. Each worker
attends for 5 days per week and has two days off per week. Workers may become infected
through contact with quarantined travellers, or through contact with infected co-workers. The
force of infection applied between travellers and workers is reduced by a factor of 100 to simulate
infection control measures (e.g., mask wearing), and limited contact. On the other hand, the force

of infection between workers is only reduced by a factor of 10 relative to unmitigated contact. This
accounts for infection control, with higher levels of mixing. Because workers are tested frequently,
infections are typically detected during the pre-symptomatic period. Infected workers are replaced
with susceptible ones after either detection or recovery. We note that replacement after recovery
is not strictly realistic but avoids eventual saturation of the recovered worker population over long
simulations.
7
B. Scenarios: vaccine efficacy and pathogen transmissibility
The scenarios we selected are designed to determine how the risk associated with quarantine
breaches is mitigated within a pathway exclusive to fully vaccinated travellers. Such a pathway
would be staffed exclusively by vaccinated workers as well, for 100% vaccination coverage within
the system. In this context, we examine performance over a wide range of vaccine efficacy and
viral transmissibility parameters. Performance is determined relative to a baseline scenario, in
which vaccine efficacy (V E) is set to 0, and disease transmission parameters are aligned to
COVID-19 strains in circulation prior to the emergence of the Delta variant.
In the quarantine and community transmission model systems, vaccines play three important
roles:
• vaccination of travellers prior to departure reduces the proportion of infected arrivals by a
factor of (1 − V E) from the base rate of 1%
• vaccination of workers and travellers limits transmission within quarantine (which reduces
the rate of breach events)
• mass vaccination prevents outbreaks in the community when quarantine breach events occur
For efficacy of vaccination against transmission, we investigate the range between 0% and 90%
total efficacy. While the quarantine model treats vaccine efficacy as a combination of efficacy
against infection VI and efficacy against onward transmission from breakthrough infections VT ,
we simplify to a single efficacy parameter for the scenarios investigated here. This is because we
assume all individuals in the system are vaccinated. We note that for scenarios in which only
a subset of individuals are vaccinated, this simplifying assumption would need to be relaxed to
account for interactions involving combinations of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. As
noted above, we consider efficacy of 0% as a baseline, accounting for the levels of incursion
risk existing before vaccines became available. Efficacy levels of 80%-90% are indicative of the
conditions existing for the COVID-19 ancestral lineage and Alpha variants previously in circulation
[25, 26]. Lower efficacy ranges can account for the emergence of variants capable of higher levels
of breakthrough infection (such as the currently dominant Delta variant).
The emergence of viral variants also requires us to investigate a broad range of transmission
rates. The transmissibility of the Delta variant has been estimated to be approximately twice
8
that of the ancestral (non VOC) lineages [27]. Based on a well-traced outbreak in China (Guangdong province, May 2021), the basic reproductive ratio for the Delta variant is estimated to be
approximately 6 [16, 17]. Therefore, in order to understand the scaling of quarantine system
performance with disease transmissibility, we examine a wide range of possibilities from R0 = 1
to R0 = 10.
C. Model variations: shorter incubation period
In our baseline model, we sample the viral incubation period (time between infection and
symptom onset) as described in studies of the ancestral lineage [28]. This estimate also influences
our model of test sensitivity as a function of time from symptom onset [29] (see Supporting
Information).
Quarantine systems operating under the “test and release” framework are primarily designed
to prevent individuals infected elsewhere from entering the community. The timing considerations
applied to this operational framework (i.e., a 14-day minimum stay) are designed to exceed the
disease incubation period. From this perspective, the emergence of variants with incubation
periods different to those for which the system was designed, can be expected to alter system
performance. System performance should, in general, improve for shorter incubation periods.
In the context of COVID-19, recent reports suggest that the Delta variant may have a shorter
incubation period than that of the ancestral lineage [16]. However, other reports using data
from the same outbreak indicate that the incubation period of the Delta variant has not changed
substantially [17]. Given the preliminary evidence for a shorter incubation period, we performed
a sensitivity analysis of this key parameter (see Supporting Information).
D. Model outputs
The quarantine facility model produces a timeseries of “breach events” each of which corresponds to an infected individual (worker or traveller) interacting with the community outside of
quarantine. For an infected traveller, this can occur for two reasons: (1) leaving case isolation
while still infectious (i.e., after the 10-day isolation period), or (2) leaving quarantine after a
false negative test result. The recorded breach event accounts for the number of days over which
9
the individual will remain infectious after leaving quarantine, and the integrated force of infection produced by the individual over that period. For infected workers, recorded breach events
account for the time from infection to either detection or recovery, and the integrated force of
infection over that period. In general, the community force of infection produced by a breach
event associated with case i is given as:
βi =
X
t ∈ tc
β(t, i)∆t , (1)
where βi
is the integrated force of infection produced by agent i outside of quarantine, tc represents
the set of discrete timepoints over which individual i is infectious in the community, β(t, i) is
the time-dependent force of infection for case i, and ∆t is the discrete time step used in the
simulation (here, ∆t = 0.1 days).
Breach events are rare due to the effectiveness of the quarantine system, particularly when
those within it are vaccinated at high efficacy. To generate a large number of breach events for
use in comparing outbreak statistics between scenarios, each simulation lasts for 106 days. Recall
that workers are tested daily so that infections are typically detected during the pre-symptomatic
period. Infected workers are replaced after either detection or recovery (the latter avoids eventual
saturation of the recovered worker population over long simulations). The different conditions
for breach events involving travellers and workers produce qualitatively different breach statistics
that depend also on vaccine efficacy and R0 (Figure 3). More details of the quarantine simulation
model can be found in the Supporting Information.
We evaluated the effectiveness of the quarantine system by examining the integrated force of
infection introduced into the community due to breach events. This value is computed as:
βtot =
Xn
i=1
βi
, (2)
where n is the total number of breach events simulated in a given scenario, and βi
is the force of
infection in the community produced by breach i. Because all other model parameters are held
constant (see Methods), βtot is a useful representation of the relative performance of the system
for different combinations of V E and R0. In Figure 4, βtot computed for each set of parameters
is shown relative to the value computed for the baseline scenario with R0 = 3 and V E = 0%.
Here, we assume that breakthrough cases are just as contagious as infections in unvaccinated
individuals. That is, we assume the vaccine acts primarily to protect those immunised from

(increased transmissibility, decreased vaccine efficacy). Breach events can occur from infected
travellers being discharged from quarantine while still infectious. They can also occur or due to
infected workers that are not detected while pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic due to false-negative
RT-PCR screening tests. The distribution of days infectious in the community differs qualitatively

infection (VT = 0, VI = V E). While there is evidence for reduced periods of viral shedding in
vaccinated individuals, peak viral loads appear to be similar [30]. Therefore, we have presented
the results based on a conservative assumption, that can be relaxed or modified as new evidence
emerges (see the Supporting Information for a sensitivity analysis given an alternate assumption
that VT = V E and VI = 0).
The influence of the quarantine system on outbreak risk was computed by using the distribution
of breach events produced by the quarantine simulation to sample seeding events for the branching
11
process model. In these outbreak scenarios, the level of population-wide vaccination is varied,
assuming a negligible level of infection-acquired immunity. The results of the branching process
model are used to estimate the probability of a community outbreak, given a fixed volume of
travellers and a set infection prevalence. This produces an absolute outbreak risk, that we express
as the time until the probability of a transmission cluster containing more than 5 cases exceeds
95% (t95). These values should be interpreted as a means of comparing alternate scenarios, given
fixed quantities of incoming arrivals (see the Supporting Information for details of the branching
process model).
III. RESULTS
A. Summary
Our results demonstrate how the quarantine system would perform under different conditions
of vaccine efficacy and viral transmissibility under fixed assumptions with respect to details such
as test schedules and quarantine duration (see Supporting Information). We quantify this in
terms of the breach events produced under each set of conditions. Breach events occur when an
infected traveller or quarantine worker comes into contact with the general population. First, we
examine the force of infection produced by breach events, which serves as a measure of quarantine
system performance independent of the community in which it is embedded. Then, we examine
the potential for outbreaks caused by breach events, taking into account the level of vaccination
coverage in the general population.
We also investigate the sensitivity of model outcomes to the disease incubation period, which
may be shorter for the Delta variant of COVID-19. The results of this analysis show that shorter
incubation periods make the quarantine system more effective because: (i) overall infectious
periods are shorter, (ii) test sensitivity increases more quickly after infection, and (iii) the shorter
delay to symptom expression hastens detection after false negative arrival tests.
Finally, we examine the sensitivity of our results to the choice of vaccine efficacy decomposition. We treat disease transmission as a two-part process first requiring infection (subject to
the efficacy term VI efficacy against infection, and then requiring onward transmission (subject
to the efficacy term VT efficacy against onward transmission). In this model the overall efficacy
12
against transmission V E is given as
V E = 1 − (1 − VT )(1 − VI ), (3)
which means that two extreme interpretations exist: (1) V E = VI , VT = 0 and (2) VT = V E,
VI = 0. Our main results use the first extreme (see the Methods section for a more detailed
discussion of this choice). We investigate the second extreme in our sensitivity analysis. This
gives the range of results over which any decomposition consistent with Equation 3 may fall.
B. Quarantine system breach risk
Interpreting βtot as a measure of outbreak potential under each set of conditions, the heatmap
in Figure 4 illustrates how vaccine efficacy must increase to offset the rise in outbreak potential
produced by increases in R0. From baseline conditions (V E = 0%, R0 = 3), following the
outermost contour delineated in Figure 4 illustrates that vaccine efficacy must exceed 60% in
order for baseline risk levels to be maintained for an R0 of 6, and must exceed 70% for R0 = 8.
The required V E levels saturate for high values of R0, with efficacy of 70% to 80% sufficient to
maintain baseline risk levels even for R0 = 10. This saturation occurs because transmission within
the quarantine environment is partially constrained by the grouping of arrivals into small cohorts
(i.e., family units). This constraint on transmission is contingent upon substantial reduction
of exposure risk outside of close contact groups, representative of stringent infection control
measures within a facility.
C. Community outbreak risk
Next we simulate outbreaks based on the distribution of quarantine breach events produced by
the quarantine model. For these scenarios we investigate a subset of V E and R0 combinations
corresponding to plausible values for the Delta variant of COVID-19. We investigated population
outbreak characteristics for V E ∈ [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9] and for R0 ∈ [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], while
varying mass vaccination coverage levels. For the branching process scenarios, a fixed traveller
arrival rate of 3000/wk was assumed, with an infection prevalence of 10%. This differed from the
inflow assumptions of the quarantine model (50 travellers per week, 1% infection prevalence), so
a scaling factor was used to linearly adjust the breach rate produced by the quarantine model
13
FIG. 4. Integrated force of infection relative to baseline computed from quarantine breach events
simulated by the model. The heatmap and contour demonstrates how this value scales with vaccine
efficacy (V E), and the basic reproductive ratio of the virus (R0). In these simulations, all incoming
arrivals and quarantine workers are vaccinated, with susceptibility to infection reduced by the factor
indicated by V E (i.e., V E = VI , VT = 0). The dotted blue box represents plausible values for the
baseline condition when the ancestral lineage and Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 were dominant
and no vaccines were available. The green dotted box represents the scenarios corresponding to
vaccinated quarantine pathways before emergence of the Delta variant. The yellow dashed box
covers a range of values plausible for Delta variant scenarios.
(see Methods in Supporting Information). This scaling approximation assumes linear dependence
of the quarantine breach rate with incoming arrival infection prevalence up to 10%.
We present t95 values as a function of vaccine coverage (Figure 5), which demonstrates the
effect of mass vaccination on outbreak risk, for each combination of V E and R0. The results
illustrate that vaccine efficacy is a crucial determinant of outbreak risk. Even for high coverage,
14
a vaccine with efficacy below 60% is not sufficient to dramatically reduce time required for
outbreaks to occur. On the other hand, a possible threshold behaviour with coverage is observed
for high vaccine efficacy (80% or higher), with t95 values increasing by an order of magnitude
for high coverage levels. This threshold effect appears to persist even for very high transmission
rates (Figure 5f, R0 = 10). The sensitivity of outbreak risk to V E emphasise the importance
of accurately estimating this crucial parameter (vaccine efficacy against infection and onward
transmission).
D. Sensitivity analysis: incubation period
Our sensitivity analysis of the incubation period demonstrated that shorter incubation periods
increase the effectiveness of the quarantine system because (i) test sensitivity increases more
rapidly, and (ii) individuals are infectious for shorter periods of time. These results emphasise
that shorter incubation periods can make it easier to detect infections in closed systems like
quarantine facilities. This reduces the risk to the community for the same quarantine length-ofstay.
E. Sensitivity analysis: Vaccine efficacy against transmission from breakthrough infections
The results demonstrated in Figure 4 assume no effect of vaccination on the capacity for
vaccinated individuals who become infected to transmit the virus (VT = 0, VI = V E). The
alternate assumption that efficacy against onward transmission is equivalent to the total V E
represents a plausible upper bound, that we investigated in a sensitivity analysis (VT = V E, VI =
0). The results in Figure S12 demonstrate that under this alternate (optimistic) assumption, the
vaccine efficacy required to maintain baseline risk levels falls by about 20%. For example, an R0
of 6 would require a 40% effective vaccine in order to maintain baseline outbreak risk while an
R0 of 8 would require a 50% effective vaccine.
IV. DISCUSSION
The vaccines that have been developed against SARS-CoV-2 remain highly effective at preventing severe disease. However, their efficacy against infection has decreased against the Delta

variants [31, 32]. In the context of border quarantine, the capacity to limit transmission is the key
consideration when determining how best to manage new arrivals, some of whom may be infected
(asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic). This is because the primary purpose of a border quarantine system is to prevent infectious individuals from entering the community. The management
of clinical cases within the quarantine system is facilitated by regular surveillance, efficient case
detection, and the allocation of medical resources. Therefore, the utility of vaccination within
the context of a quarantine system is not equivalent to the utility of mass vaccination in the
context of a large outbreak. In large outbreaks, efficacy against clinical severity reduces hospital
case loads and deaths, mitigating the public health burden and human cost, even if transmission
continues. However, in modern quarantine systems, the operational goal is to identify and isolate
cases to limit transmission and keep the required duration of quarantine to a minimum.
The 14-day minimum stay commonly practiced during the COVID-19 pandemic was implemented due to the long incubation period of the disease. Within 14 days, a case arriving while
pre-symptomatic would be likely to display symptoms. Testing of arrivals through RT-PCR accelerates the process of case detection and facilitates earlier management. When these case
detection efforts are unsuccessful, transmission within the quarantine environment at best leads
to extended stay conditions for cases and their contacts. At worst, it leads to the discharge
of pre-symptomatic infectious individuals who receive their exit test early in their infection and
do not yet have high enough viral load for case confirmation. Therefore, the primary benefit of
vaccination in the context of quarantine facilities is in limiting transmission.
In this context, the increased transmissibility and decreased vaccine efficacy against transmission associated with the Delta variant requires a re-evaluation of risk. Our results demonstrate
that vaccination may allow quarantine systems to remain effective. On the other hand, quarantine
requirements for vaccinated travellers must remain stringent due to the increased transmissibility
of the virus. To emphasise the implications of this result, had conditions remained consistent
with the Alpha variant (R0 ≈ 3, V E ≈ 90%), Figure 4 indicates that vaccination would have
decreased border quarantine breach risk to 3% of baseline. In effect, the vaccinated quarantine pathway would have allowed the number of arrivals to increase by a factor of approx. 30
(assuming sufficient system capacity), while maintaining baseline community exposure levels.
Under the existing circumstances, our analysis suggests that quarantine policies for vaccinated
17
individuals will need to approximate those that were used for unvaccinated cohorts prior to the
emergence of the Delta variant. Unvaccinated cohorts of travellers, on the other hand, will pose
a much greater risk of quarantine breach events than they did previously (e.g., increased by a
factor of 3 for R0 = 6, Figure 4).
Ultimately, the level of stringency in requirements for quarantine of new arrivals should be
assessed as a function of the prevalence of viral variants between jurisdictions. Where these
relative levels are similar for variants of concern, there is little justification for limitations on
travel. However, with the spatially-localised emergence of new variants, quarantine systems must
be capable of rapidly responding to slow, or eliminate, the global diffusion of variants. This is
particularly true for variants with increased transmissibility and clinical severity (of which the
Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is a primary example).
V. CONCLUSION
To summarise, our results demonstrate that, in the context of SARS-CoV-2, border quarantine systems cannot be used to compensate for low levels of community vaccination. For the
Delta variant, this is true even when all individuals within the quarantine environment are vaccinated. This is because the Delta variant is more transmissible and likely to produce breakthrough
infections in individuals vaccinated against the ancestral lineage. Our findings illustrate a key
aspect of the drawn-out global battle to mitigate the public health crisis produced by COVID-19.
Just as regions with low community prevalence were becoming confident that international travel
could increase for vaccinated individuals, the virus changed to become more transmissible, and
to partially avoid vaccine-induced immunity. Our results show that these changes nullified the
prospective benefits of quarantine systems in terms of international travel volumes. However, it
is important to emphasize the alternative scenario: had a vaccine not become available prior to
the emergence of the Delta variant, the capacity for existing border quarantine systems to mitigate outbreaks would have dramatically deteriorated. Currently, comprehensive vaccination in
quarantine facilities is allowing countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and China to continue
allowing low levels of international travel.
Moving forward, the expansion of quarantine systems should focus on preparing for future
variants of COVID-19, and ultimately, for future pandemics with higher clinical severity and
18
infection fatality ratios. COVID-19 has revealed the unprecedented capacity for populations
around the world to dramatically alter their behaviour to prevent disease spread. Quarantine
systems amplify the payoff of these population-wide responses by limiting incursions. The coupling
of border quarantine measures with elimination strategies buys critical time for the development
of vaccines and effective clinical practices.

S1. MODEL DETAILS
This work utilised two distinct models of COVID-19 disease transmission. One of these is
an abstract model, implemented as a branching process to approximate community transmission dynamics. This is applied to quantify the tendency for quarantine breach events to initiate
outbreaks, and to characterise those outbreaks. The other model is an agent-based simulation
describing disease progression and transmission on the individual level. This is implemented in two
scenarios, one used for calibration of fundamental parameters, and the other for investigation of
quarantine system efficacy. The calibration scenario is homogeneous, and allows characterisation
of the basic reproductive ratio, over-dispersed secondary case rates, and timing of transmission
detection events in an effectively open system. The quarantine scenario is designed to reproduce the general features of controlled border screening environments, and implements a defined
population structure.
A. Outbreak transmission (Branching process) model
To simulate infectious individuals entering the community and potentially seeding an outbreak,
we use a branching process community transmission model with an inhomogenous offspring distribution. Branching process models are considered in terms of generations, and each generation
acts independently from the last. We term ‘generation zero’ to be the index case that leaves
quarantine.
1. Transmission potential of cases in the community
We define the transmission potential, which represents the expected number of cases caused
by a single case in the community. The transmission potential combines the biological features
of the virus, vaccine status of the index case, vaccination coverage in the wider community and
vaccine efficacy parameters.
We break down vaccine efficacy into two components: efficacy against infection, denoted VI ,
and efficacy against onward transmission, denoted VT . The overall reduction in transmission is
S1
given by,
V = (1 − VI )(1 − VT ).
For a given starting transmission potential, T P0, the effective transmission potential in the population, T Pp, is given by,
T Pp = T P0 · (1 − cV ),
where c is the proportion of the population vaccinated. For a breach caused by a vaccinated
traveller, the first generation transmission potential is given by,
T Pu = T P0 · (1 − cVI ).
For a breach caused by an unvaccinated traveller, the first generation transmission potential is
given by,
T Pv = T P0 · (1 − cVI )(1 − VT ).
2. Secondary case distribution and public health measures
The number of secondary infections generated by a single case is taken from a negative binomial
distribution, with n = 0.1 samples, and the probability of success being p = 0.1/(0.1 + T P), in
order to match the dispersion in the number of secondary cases (fixed at 0.1), and the expected
number of secondary cases.
The calendar times at which these infections occur is drawn from a Weibull distribution with
mean 5.5 days and standard deviation 1.8, in line with literature estimates [33].
If the case is the index case and thus in quarantine, only infections that occur after the
individual has left quarantine are retained. If the individual enters isolation at some point, as
per worker protocols, then only infections that occur before the individual has entered isolation
are retained. All future generations are assumed to not be in quarantine or have any proactive
isolation applied to them.
3. Probability of a breach becoming an outbreak
To calculate the probability of a single breach event becoming an outbreak, we simulate 105
breaches into the community. The index cases for these breaches are chosen randomly from the
quarantine model. The probability is calculated separately for travellers and workers.
S2
A breach is defined as an outbreak if it reaches at least five cumulative cases before extinction.
4. Time until significant breach event
The time between breach events are assumed to occur at a frequency defined by the quarantine
model. To scale this time according to the number of travellers and the prior probability of arriving
to the system infected, we construct a scaling factor,
s =
A
A¯
I
¯I
,
where A is the targeted number of arrival, I is the targeted prevalence of the arrival’s country, A¯
is the number of arrivals modelled in the quarantine model and ¯I is the prevalence of infection
assumed in the quarantine model. The time between breaches obtained from the quarantine
model is divided by s.
A breach is determined to be an outbreak according to a binomial distribution, with probability
of success defined by the probability of causing an outbreak. Traveller and worker breach events
are chosen in the same proportion at which they occur from the quarantine model.
B. Individual-based COVID-19 disease model
For the agent-based model of quarantine scenarios, we developed a model of COVID-19 disease
and transmission designed to match three salient features:
1. The distribution of delays between symptom onset of a primary case and transmission to
secondary cases. Following the definition used by Ferretti et al., we refer to this quantity
as Time from Onset of Symptoms to Transmission (TOST) [34].
2. The household secondary attack rate, and secondary case dispersion.
3. The dependence of RT-PCR test sensitivity on time from symptom onset.
Matching these distributions with an individual-based model required the definition a detailed
model of disease natural history on the within-host level. The distribution of incubation periods
is a key ensemble statistic that informs the model dynamics (see below). There are many possible
implementations of within-host models that could generate the required ensemble statistics. Our
S3
specific choices follow the logic that virus initially grows exponentially, until recognition by the
host immune systems triggers the onset of symptoms (the end of the incubation period). This
immune response produces an exponential decline in viral load until recovery occurs, at which
time no replication-competent viral shedding is possible. The sections below detail the specifics
of the agent-based model.
1. The basic reproductive number R0
The transmission rate scalar for each individual βmax ∼ Gamma(κ, θ) controls the transmission
rate for any given transmission environment. The shape parameter κ = 0.1 translates directly
to the dispersion parameter of the derived secondary case distribution (distributed as a negative
binomial, see below). The scale parameter θ = hβmaxi/κ is a function of the mean peak force of
infection hβmaxi, which is proportional to R0 in the calibration model (Figure S1).
To calibrate the basic reproductive number R0, we performed a systematic scan of hβmaxi,
keeping all other parameters constant. To produce a generic calibration of the basic reproductive
number R0, we performed this scan on an unstructured population with N = 500 individuals,
and simulated a large ensemble of single transmission generations without interaction effects
(N = 10,000 instances). For each instance, the index case properties are sampled from the
parameter distributions specified and transmission is simulated until recovery of the index case.
We then count the secondary cases produced, ignoring the additional force of infection produced
by secondary cases. The average of these values approximates R0, and we observe a linear
relationship with the control parameter hβmaxi (Figure S1). To set the value of R0 in a given
scenario, we use the line of best fit R0 = 3.83hβmaxi to determine the corresponding value of
hβmaxi required to produce the desired value of R0.
2. Secondary case dispersion
The distribution of secondary cases produced by the index case ensemble used to compute R0
conforms to a negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter r = 0.1 (Figure S2). This
is implemented as follows: for each index case, independent transmission probabilities produce
Poisson-distributed secondary case numbers. The transmissibility parameter for each index case
βmax is sampled from a Gamma distribution, so the secondary case numbers aggregated over

distribution with dispersion parameter (“number of successes” r = 0.1), and mean R0.
all index cases are effectively drawn from an ensemble of Poisson distributions with Gammadistributed rate parameters. This gives a negative binomial with dispersion r = κ [35]. Therefore,
the model controls secondary case dispersion directly by assigning βmax a Gamma-distributed
random variable. The choice of dispersion does not alter the calibration of R0, which describes
only the average number of secondary cases.
3. Household secondary attack rate
To check that our parameterisation of R0 and r produce reasonable correspondence with
observed household secondary attack rates, we ran the calibration model setting the population
size N = 5. Under these conditions, the number of possible transmissions is akin to a generic
number of household contacts (N - 1) and individuals with high transmissibility have restricted
transmission potential. This calibration produces average household secondary attack rates in
a range between 10% and 25%, consistent with observations of COVID-19 transmission among
household contacts (Figure S3) [17, 36]. The low end of the range (10%) is typical for the
ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2, and this increases consistently with R0, reaching 25% for

4. Individual-based disease transmission model
Our individual-based model of within-host viral dynamics follows a three-part function, the
precise form of which is determined by each individual’s incubation period. An individual trajectory of infectiousness as a function of time from exposure β(t) is illustrated in Figure S4. This
function features an initial exponential increase, followed by a brief plateau and subsequent exponential decline. The start of the exponential decline phase corresponds to the end of individual’s
incubation period (onset of symptoms). Note that individuals become infectious immediately
after they are infected, with no latent period preceding the onset of infectiousness. In our model,
we assume that 1/3 of infected individuals never develop symptoms, which reduces the probability
they will be detected within the quarantine system. In our model we use the same functional
S7
form of β(t) to describe all infections, regardless of whether or not they are asymptomatic. It
may be that asymptomatic individuals are marginally less contagious, in which case our model
would overestimate the number of secondary cases they produce [37]. In this work, we opted for
the conservative assumption that no difference exists.
The within-host dynamics are implemented as a piecewise function, with a plateau between
growth and decay phases describing β(t), the time-dependent infectiousness of an individual:
β(t) =

, (S1)
where tinc is the incubation period of the individual, Tp is the duration of the infectiousness plateau
(set equal to 0.1tinc), and βmax is the maximum infectiousness of that individual. The parameter
Vmax is a scaling factor controlling the shape of the growth curve (smaller values of Vmax produce
broader growth and decay functions, higher values produce steeper growth and decay). The rate
parameters k1 and k2 are determined by the value of Vmax, and the duration of incubation and
post-incubation periods:

where tr is the time between symptom onset and recovery, which is drawn uniformly at random from the range [5d, 10d], to approximately match the duration of replication-competent
viral shedding after symptom onset [38]. For an interaction between infected individual i and
susceptible individual j, the probability of transmission is computed as:
pij (t) = 1 − exp(−β(t, i)σij∆t), (S4)
where β(t, i) is the force of infection produced by an infected individual i at time t since infection,
∆t = 0.1 days is the duration of a discrete time step, and σij is a scaling factor that incorporates
the effects of contact frequency and intensity for a given transmission event between infected
individual i and susceptible individual j:

where Fij is a context-specific transmission mitigation factor, and hj

In the full quarantine model, Fij is given as follows:
• For close contacts between travellers in the same group,
Fij = 1, and hj = ni − 1, where ni
is the number of close contacts in the same group as
individual i (n = 4 initially but can decrease if members are moved into isolation).
• For interactions between travellers in different close contact groups,

FIG. S4. An example of the force of infection produced by an infected individual as a function of
time from infection. The force of infection increases exponentially from the time of infection to the
start of the plateau, at which point it reaches its maximum value. The plateau phase lasts until
the end of the incubation period and has a duration equal to 1/10 of the total incubation period.
Incubation periods are drawn from a log-normal distribution. During the post-incubation period,
infectiousness decreases exponentially until it reaches a cutoff at the time of recovery. The duration
between the end of the plateau phase and recovery is drawn from a uniform distribution bounded
between 5 and 10 days. The y-axis values are re-scaled to βmax, which is drawn from a Gamma
distribution parameterised for a specified R0 value as described in Section S1 B 1.
5. Time from Onset of Symptoms to Transmission (TOST)
The functional form used for β(t) was developed to match the ensemble distributions of time
from onset of symptoms to transmission (TOST), reported by Ferretti et al. [34]. A comparison
of the statistics produced by the calibration model and the distribution reported by Ferretti et
al. is shown in Figure S5. The qualitative match between our model’s case statistics and the
empirical TOST distribution is sensitive to the choice of individual disease trajectory function

(Equations S1 through S3).
6. Time from Onset of Symptoms to Detection (TOSD)
The model of test sensitivity discussed in the following subsections is designed to capture
the variability in RT-PCR test sensitivity as a function of time relative to symptom onset. These
models are based on a study by Hellewell et al. [29]. Here, the general objective is to describe test
sensitivity as a piecewise sigmoid with a single breakpoint, Tc. Before the breakpoint sensitivity
increases (t < Tc, where t represents time from infection). After the breakpoint (t > Tc),
sensitivity decreases slowly. In this case, the function is expressed as a logistic regression:
S11
parameter 95% CI
Tc [2.01, 5.11]
b1 [0.8, 2.31]
b2 [1.26, 3.47]
b3 [-1.2, -1.05]
TABLE S1. Parameter ranges used in Hellewell et al., to describe the progression of test sensitivity
during COVID-19 infections in healthcare workers. In the model reported here, these parameter
ranges were adjusted to account for individual variability in incubation periods.
p(positive|infected) =



[1 + exp(−(b1 + b2τ ))]−1
t ≤ Tc
[1 + exp(−(b1 + b2τ + b2b3τ )]−1
t > Tc
, (S6)
where τ = t − Tc, the maximum test sensitivity depends only on b1 as [1 + exp(−b1)]−1
, the
initial growth of sensitivity is controlled by b2, and the decay of sensitivity after Tc is given by b2
and b3. The parameter ranges (95% credible intervals) provided in Hellewell et al. are shown in
table S1.
The parameter ranges shown in Table S1 were produced by fitting to ensemble data. That
is, the study examined a timeseries of tests and test results for a cohort of 27 individuals, and
aggregated this timeseries in order to fit the parameters of the model. Therefore, the parameter
ranges above are not suitable for all individual test sensitivity trajectories. Our individual-based
model translates the specified functional form (piece-wise logistic function) and parameter ranges
into a set of trajectories describing test sensitivity as a function of the incubation period (time
between infection and symptom onset) for each individual in the system. By doing so, we reconcile
the ensemble characteristics observed by Hellewell et al., with the requirements of individual
trajectories. In our model, the requirements are specified as follows:
• An individual may not test positive before they are infected.
S12
• The peak of test sensitivity must have some correspondence to the timing of the peak viral
load (peak infectiousness).
• The probability of detection should be high during the first week of symptoms.
These requirements have the following implications for the model framework specified by Hellewell
et al.:
• the specified range of Tc will not fit trajectories with longer-than-average incubation periods
(average incubation period is 5.5 days).
• The rate of increase (b2) must be higher for individuals with shorter incubation periods
(this imposes a correlation when specifying individual trajectories).
To address these discrepancies, we relax the parameter restrictions in Table S1, and set the
breakpoint position relative to an individual’s incubation period. The delay between the breakpoint
Tc and the onset of symptoms tinc is distributed in the range [0, 4.11].The rationale for this choice
is based on the observation that the upper 95% credible interval reported by Hellewell, Tc = 5.11,
is approximately equivalent to the median incubation period. Here, we infer that this corresponds
to using the incubation period as an upper limit for Tc. Additionally, our model correlates the
length of the delay with the incubation period of each agent by quantile matching, to ensure the
that Tc is always positive:
Tc,i = tinc, i − 4.11qi
, (S7)
where i denotes a specific individual, qi
is the value of the incubation period CDF evaluated at
tinc(i), and 4.11 is the range of possible delays (in units of days) between peak test sensitivity
and symptom onset.
To provide a better match to ensemble statistics, we also chose to impose a negative correlation
between individual incubation periods and the term (b2) that specifies the growth rate of test
sensitivity before the peak, and (along with b3) the decay rate of test sensitivity after the peak:
b2,i = 1.26 − 2.21(1 − qi), (S8)
where 1.26 is the lower bound for b2 and 2.21 is the range of b2 values given in Table S2. The
modified parameter ranges are shown in Table S2, samples of individual trajectories are shown in
Figure S6, and a comparison of ensemble statistics is shown in Figure S7. On the other hand,
S13

TABLE S2. Parameter ranges used in order to fit the ABM ensemble statistics to those reported
by Hellewell et al..
the b1 and b3 parameters are chosen uniformly at random for each individual from the ranges
specified in S2.
The model as-implemented approximately matches the proportion of infections detected before
symptom onset, given daily RT-PCR test, estimated by Hellewell et al. (approx. 75%). The
corresponding distribution of time from onset of symptoms to detection (TOSD), is shown in
Figure S7(c). In this system, daily testing detects approximately 78% of cases prior to symptom
onset.

S16
C. Model of quarantine environment
The model of quarantine system in which transmission occurs, explicitly represents individual
travellers and quarantine workers. We describe the model in terms of an Input layer, Filter layer
and Output layer.
1. Input layer
Arriving travellers are characterised in terms of:
• the proportion of arriving travellers who are infected
• the proportion of arriving travellers who are vaccinated
Here, we set the proportion of infected arrivals to 1% and the proportion vaccinated to 100%.
Additionally, it is assumed that infected arrivals are either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. If
an arrival is pre-symptomatic their time since infection is sampled at random from the individual’s
incubation period. If a traveller is asymptomatic, their time since infection on arrival is sampled
from the sum of their incubation period and post-incubation period.
2. Filter layer
Travellers: Quarantined travellers are structured into groups who are quarantined together
(e.g., in the same room). For the results presented here, the size of these groups is set to 4, and
the number of travellers in the facility is set to 100. Travellers are discharged from the system
in groups. Once all travellers in a group meet the discharge criteria, the group is removed and a
new group generated to replace them.
Workforce: The quarantine workforce is also represented. The workforce model specifies a
weekly work schedule for each individual, including 5 days working and 2 days off. On days and
off days are scheduled randomly, and a work schedule configuration is accepted by the model as
long as at least 5/20 workers are present each day of the week.
Transmission control: We assume that the rate of transmission between travellers who
belong to different groups is reduced by a factor of 100, compared to that between travellers
S17
who belong to the same group. Similarly, we assume a factor of 100 reduction in transmission
between travellers and workers, and a factor of 10 reduction between workers.
Vaccination: The efficacy of vaccination may be varied to reflect available evidence. As
above, we assume that some proportion of the workforce, and some proportion of arriving travellers
will have been vaccinated. Vaccine efficacy parameters can be varied to reflect the characteristics
of vaccines used in particular source countries of interest. In this work, we assume that all
individuals in the quarantine system are vaccinated. We implement vaccination by setting efficacy
against infection (VI = V E) and efficacy against onward transmission VT = 0. This choice is
not significant when computing transmission within the quarantine system, because all individuals
are assumed vaccinated. However, the components of vaccine efficacy could play a significant
role when interpreting the force of infection produced by breach events (see sensitivity analysis
below).
Testing: Testing of workers can be scheduled at varying frequencies (e.g., daily, every three
days, or weekly) and workers will only be tested on days that they attend the workplace. In the
results reported here, testing of the workforce is performed daily, as long as a worker is present.
The model includes testing of travellers that can be scheduled to occur on given days during
their quarantine period. For the results reported here, travellers were tested on days 3 and 12
after entering quarantine. We calibrated test sensitivity as specified above, to represent detection
via RT-PCR.
Response to a positive test or symptoms: If a worker tests positive or develops symptoms,
we assume that they are removed from the workforce and replaced by a new worker (irrespective
of whether they attend work that day or not).
If a traveller tests positive or develops symptoms, they are isolated and removed from the
quarantine facility (e.g., to a “health hotel” or hospital), the isolation period is set to 10 days,
after which they are released. A positive test result in a traveller triggers a 14-day quarantine
extension for other travellers in the same group, and resets their testing schedule (tests performed
on days 3 and 12 after extension).
S18
3. Output
The output of the quarantine simulation is a time series of “breach events” with the corresponding characteristics of each individual that leaves quarantine while infected. Several properties are
recorded, and the recorded properties depend on whether the infected individual was a worker or
traveller. For travellers, the recorded properties are:
• exposure days: the number of days they will remain infectious
• days in quarantine: the total number of days spent in the quarantine system
• days in extended quarantine: the number of days in quarantine extension after detection
of a case in a close contact
• days in isolation: the number of days spent in isolation after testing positive or presenting
symptoms
• incubation period: the period between infection and symptom onset
• time post-incubation: the period between symptom onset and recovery
• time discharged: the timepoint at which the individual was released from quarantine
• index case (boolean): a flag indicating whether the individual arrived infected or was
infected while in quarantine
• symptomatic (boolean): a flag indicating whether the individual would express clinical
symptoms after their incubation period
• vaccinated (boolean): a flag indicting the individual’s vaccination status
• βmax: the maximum force of infection for the individual (i.e., force of infection at symptom
onset)
• βcommunity: the integrated force of infection over the period after the individual was discharged from quarantine (these are summed to produce the βtot value for a simulation)
For workers, the recorded properties are:
S19
• exposure days: the number of days between infection and detection or recovery
• incubation period: same as for travellers (see above)
• post-incubation period: same as for travellers (see above)
• tested positive (boolean): a flag indicating whether the individual was removed after testing
positive
• expressed symptoms (boolean): a flag indicating whether the individual was removed after
expressing symptoms
• time discharged: the timepoint at which the individual was removed from the facility
• symptomatic (boolean): same as for travellers (see above)
• vaccinated (boolean): same as for travellers (see above)
• βmax: same as for travellers (see above)
• βcommunity: the force of infection integrated over the period from infection to detection
and discharge.
This output timeseries is used to generate input statistics for the index cases used in the
branching process model.
S2. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF INCUBATION PERIOD
To estimate the effect of a shorter incubation period, we used the statistics reported by the
China CDC for an outbreak of the Delta variant in May, 2021 [16]. While their estimates of
the incubation period may differ from those of others [17], they represent a lower bound for
this important parameter. Here, we demonstrate how a shorter incubation period affects the
transmission and detection of the virus in our model system. The main differences are:
• Without intervention, slightly less transmission occurs prior to symptom onset.
• Due to a more rapid increase in viral load, detection of cases typically occurs earlier.

the distribution used for the main results, while the red trace indicates the distribution used in the
sensitivity analysis.
• In the quarantine model scenario, a shorter overall duration of infection increases the efficacy
of a 14-day quarantine.
These results demonstrate how shorter incubation periods can correspond to an enhanced capacity
to control transmission. Our results caution against the use of these preliminary estimates of
incubation period statistics for use in models of border quarantine systems. As we demonstrate,
they potentially over-estimate the effectiveness of these systems and do not represent conservative
assumptions about viral dynamics.
To investigate the effect of incubation period, we first re-calibrated the base model using the
modified incubation period distribution (Figure S9). During calibration, we determined the timing
of symptom onset relative to transmission, and the timing of detection relative to symptom onset,
given daily testing via RT-PCR in a homogeneous transmission network of 500 individuals (Figure
S10). We then applied this modified calibration in the full quarantine simulation to examine the
effectiveness of quarantine over the V E × R0 parameter space. The results are qualitatively
similar to those produced by the original calibration (average incubation period 5.2 days), but
show consistently lower levels of breach risk as measured by βtot.

FIG. S11. Integrated force of infection (βtot relative to baseline) using an incubation period with
a mean of 4.4 days. The baseline (denominator) value is taken from the alternate scenario with an
incubation period of 5.5 days (R0 = 3, V E = 0). Results are shown as a function of vaccine efficacy
and R0.
S3. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF VACCINE EFFICACY AGAINST ONWARD TRANSMISSION
For the results presented in Figure 4, it was assumed that vaccine efficacy against onward
transmission is negligible. That is, the values reported for βtot represent differences in breach
statistics rather than the direct effects of vaccine efficacy. Here, we examine the alternate extreme
case in which efficacy against transmission is equivalent to V E. This equates to multiplication of
the βtot values in Figure 4 by the factor 1 − V E. Doing so results in a correction applied to the
force of infection values, which fall linearly as V E increases. Under this alternate assumption,
for each value of R0 the vaccine efficacy required to maintain baseline outbreak statistics is lower
(S12). The magnitude of the difference increases with R0, ranging from approximately 10%
(for R0 = 4) up to approximately 20% (for R0 = 10). While these differences are substantial,
they represent the largest possible deviation due to efficacy against transmission. Therefore, the
results presented in Figure 4 may overestimate the vaccine efficacy required to maintain baseline
risk ratios, but the magnitude of this overestimate cannot exceed 20%.
