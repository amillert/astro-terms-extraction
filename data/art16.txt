Flavor Violating Axions in the Early Universe
Flavor violating axion couplings can be in action before recombination, and they can fill the early
universe with an additional radiation component. Working within a model-independent framework,
we consider an effective field theory for the axion field and quantify axion production. Current
cosmological data exclude already a fraction of the available parameter space, and the bounds will
improve significantly with future CMB-S4 surveys. Remarkably, we find that future cosmological
bounds will be comparable or even stronger than the ones obtained in our terrestrial laboratories.
Introduction. Light and weakly-coupled particles arise
naturally as new degrees of freedom within motivated
theoretical constructions for physics beyond the standard
model (SM). A notable example is the QCD axion [1, 2]
within Peccei-Quinn (PQ) theories [3, 4]. Not only these
frameworks provide a dynamical solution to the strong
CP problem, but also they can account for the observed
dark matter abundance [5–7]. Typically, the axion field
couples to several SM particles [8, 9], and experimentalists search for the effects of these interactions both in the
early universe [10] and in our laboratories [11–13].
In this work, we study the cosmological implications of
axion couplings that are not diagonal in the SM fermion
generations. These interactions can arise from radiative
corrections with both loop and GIM suppressions even
if the underlying theory does not violate flavor [14–18].
Alternatively, flavor violation (FV) can be present already at tree-level [19–27]. We remain agnostic about
the high-energy origin, and we work within the effective
field theory framework

The FV interactions in Eq. (1) mediate axion production in the early universe. This relativistic axion population manifests itself today in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum as an additional radiation component, an effect historically parameterized
in terms of an effective number of additional neutrino
species ∆Neff. This cosmic axion background, analogous
to the one made of SM neutrinos, is one of the cosmological consequences of the PQ mechanism [29–33].
Currently, the best bound comes from the Planck collaboration that reports Neff = 2.99 ± 0.17 [34]. Future
CMB-S4 surveys will achieve the remarkable sensitivity
∆Neff|
1σ(2σ) ' 0.03 (0.06) [35, 36]; this corresponds approximately to the contribution from axions once in thermal equilibrium that decoupled before the electroweak
phase transition [37]. These astonishing forecasts motivated recently a noteworthy effort with the aim to provide
quantitative and reliable predictions [38–48].
In what follows, we consider a single FV operator with
a given pair of SM fermions and Lorentz structure (vector or axial) at a time. When evaluating the total axion production rate γa, which is defined as the number
of processes per unit time and volume, we distinguish
between FV couplings to leptons and quarks. The former are immune from complications as we approach the
QCD phase transition (QCDPT) and perturbative calculations are reliable, the latter necessitate us to resort
to non-perturbative techniques. Broadly speaking, there
are two main production mechanisms: decays and scatterings. We divide the full production rate into these
two individual contributions, γa = γ
D
a + γ
S
a
, and explicit
expressions for the rates due to decays and scatterings
are known in the literature [49]. Decays become efficient
as the temperature approaches the mass of the mother
particle, and they are suppressed at higher temperatures
because of the Lorentz time dilation. Scatterings need
to be taken into account because the FV interactions in
Eq. (1) mediate them as well. They are not included usually in this kind of analysis because decays are expected
to dominate, but we will show how this is not always the
case. For example, axion production via scatterings is
proportional to the strong coupling constant αs when we
consider FV interactions with quarks, and this contribution gets large slightly above the QCDPT. Finally, we
feed the Boltzmann equation with the production rates
and we track how the axion population evolves in the
early universe. The output of this procedure is the evaluation of ∆Neff for the different FV couplings. We conclude with a comparison between cosmological bounds
and prospects derived in this study with current and future constraints from terrestrial experiments.

Charged lepton decays, `

literature [38, 40]. However, the same FV interaction responsible for decays mediates axion production via scatterings of thermal bath particles: lepton/antilepton annihilations (`

2/8 [50, 51]. However, axion production mediated by the operators in Eq. (1) is most efficient at lower temperatures (i.e., IR domination), and
it is maximized at temperature scales around the heavier
lepton mass. A rigorous thermal field theory treatment
would not alter the total production rate [52].
The total production rate for axion production via FV
interactions with leptons is quantified by the solid black
lines in Fig. 1. We present results for the case when the
heavier lepton involved in the interaction is µ (left panel)
or τ (right panel). For comparison, we also illustrate with
solid blue lines the partial contribution to the total production rate from lepton decays. Once we integrate the
Lagrangian in Eq. (1) by parts, we find pseudo-Yukawa
interactions with strength proportional to (m`j ∓ m`i
)
for vector and axial currents, respectively. If we neglect
the mass of the lighter lepton, the two couplings give
identical rates; the case when corrections to this degeneracy are larger is for τ -µ couplings where the difference is
nearly 30% since (mτ + mµ)
2
/ (mτ − mµ)
2 ≈ 1.3. Furthermore, results for τ -µ and τ -e couplings are nearly
equivalent for the same reason. Thus we present results combining these nearly degenerate cases together
in Fig. 1. However, in our analysis we keep these distinctions and employ the appropriate rate for each case.
At high temperatures, much higher than the mother
particle mass, the production rate is controlled by scatterings with gauge bosons. While scatterings with massive weak gauge bosons are relatively suppressed due to
their heavy mass, those with massless photons turn out

rates, respectively. Solid lines stop at the perturbative scale

to be dominant contributions to FV axion thermalization below the weak scale. Subsequently, when the thermal bath temperature approaches the mass of the heavier
lepton involved in the cubic interaction, decay processes
become more and more important to produce axions.
Hadronic Production. The description where the axion is coupled to quarks, which is what expressed by our
starting point in Eq. (1), breaks down once we reach the
confinement scale. Computing the axion production rate
for FV couplings to quarks is less straightforward.
Third generation quarks are free from this complication since their masses are larger than the temperature
where quarks confine into hadrons, and it is possible to
compute the production rate as for the lepton cases. This
is true especially for the top quark since its mass is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the confinement scale. Axion production via FV couplings to the
top quark studied in Ref. [42], and it was found that the
resulting contribution to ∆Neff is at most barely within
reach of future CMB-S4 surveys. The bottom quark is
somewhat an intermediate case since its mass is a factor
of a few larger than the scale where one loses perturbative
control of rate calculations. Axion production is essentially inefficient once we reach this problematic scale as
a consequence of the Maxwell-Boltzmann suppression in
the bottom quark number density. This was also studied
in Ref. [42], but only accounting for the decay contribution. We revisit this study by including also scatterings
to the production rate with results shown in Fig. 2 [53].
We present the numerical evaluations in a single figure
since the final state quark and the Lorentz structure affect the rate marginally for the same reasons as the ones
discussed in the lepton case. Solid lines stop at the temperature ΛN = 2 GeV, and we take this to be the fiducial
scale above which we can rely upon perturbative calculations. The bottom quark mass is approximately a factor
of two larger than ΛN, and axion production can still be
efficient at T . ΛN ; we extrapolate the production rate
down to temperatures Λ0
N = 1 GeV, shown as dashed
lines, and we checked that axion production saturates
once we get to that temperature. As it is manifest from

Figure 3. Axion production rate via FV couplings to second
generation quarks. Black and blue lines as in Fig. 2. The
rate between ΛChPT = 150 MeV and ΛN = 2 GeV is connected
smoothly via the cubic spline interpolation (dashed red).
Fig. 2, the scattering contribution overwhelms the one
from decays; the former is enhanced by αs, which does
not appear in the bottom quark decay width, evaluated
at temperatures not too far away from the QCDPT. This
correct evaluation of the rate, not implemented before,
has a dramatic impact on ∆Neff as we will see shortly.
Once we consider lighter (second generation) quarks,
we cannot avoid dealing with confinement. Perturbative QCD still provides a reliable computational tool at
T & ΛN, and we employ the techniques of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) [54–56] to describe production
via hadronic resonances. We verify that production via
scatterings is sub-dominant compared with the one from
decays, and we employ in our analysis the hadronic matrix elements provided by Ref. [57]. The Lorentz structure combined with the invariance of strong interactions
under parity select the hadronic final states from pseudoscalar meson decays: vector currents mediate decays to
an axion plus a pseudoscalar meson, axial currents provide vector meson final states. For baryon decays, both
currents contribute to the transition amplitudes.
The four panels in Fig. 3 show our numerical results.
Solid black lines indicate the total axion production rate
in the two opposite regimes where we have computational
control, and dashed red lines denote the interpolation
obtained via the cubic spline method [58]. Solid blue
lines indicate the partial production rate from quark decays in the deconfined phase that is subdominant with
respect to scatterings as a consequence of the αs enhancement. Thus within the perturbative QCD regime, valid
for T & ΛN = 2 GeV, quark and gluon scatterings control axion production. On the opposite side, we account
for production via hadron decays up to T = ΛChPT =
150 MeV above which the hadron resonance gas approximation [59–61] is not applicable [62]. We note that, in
the hadronic resonance gas framework, even hadrons with
heavy quarks such as charms and bottoms are considered to be thermalized at ΛChPT. Notwithstanding those
hadron masses much heavier than the phase boundary,
the so-called statistical hadronization approach is still
the valid way to account for their distribution with thermal weights (see Ref. [63] for details).

The output of our study is summarized by Fig. 4 where
we show results for leptonic and hadronic FV in the upper and lower panels, respectively. Cosmological constraints are identified by the green bars: dark ones denote the current bound from Planck whereas the pale and
palest green bars illustrate future prospects at 2-σ and
1-σ, respectively. A common feature is that the present
bounds become more severe as the decaying particles get
lighter, and this is because Planck is sensitive to axions
that reach thermal equilibrium around the QCDPT. Axions once in thermal equilibrium that decoupled when
the thermal bath had a temperature TD provide a dark
radiation contribution ∆Neff ' 13.69 g∗s(TD)
−4/3 with
g∗s the bath effective number of entropic degrees of freedom [46]. Thus the lighter the mother particle, the later
axions are produced, and the smaller g∗s(TD). On the
contrary, CMB-S4 prospects future an opposite behavior
because they will be testing axions that do not thermalize. In this different regime, the final abundance is proportional to the square of the interaction strength that
scales proportionally to the mass of the heavier fermion.
Numerous terrestrial experiments search for invisible
final state energy in meson decays; these processes could
be mediated by FV couplings to the axion [16, 24, 27,
57, 64–66]. For comparison, we collect in Fig. 4 current
bounds (dark bars) for each FV coupling and the expected future sensitivities (pale bars). For completeness,
we add the astrophysical constraints on F

and we depict them with shaded magenta bars.
The upper panel of Fig. 4 shows the landscape of FV
couplings to leptons. Both terrestrial searches and cosmological productions do not discriminate between vector and axial couplings, so we present constraints together and we just distinguish among lepton flavors. Current and future laboratory constraints are visualized by
the orange bars. The best bound on F

include the astrophysical SN1987A bound from Ref. [27].

will improve the sensitivity on both couplings [27].
The lower panel of Fig. 4 illustrates the current situation and future prospects for FV couplings to quarks.
Current bounds for the vector and axial currents are, respectively, represented by the red and blue bars, and the
expected sensitivities in forthcoming experiments correspond to the pale colored bars. Searches by the E949
collaboration [71] for K+ → π

bound on the vector coupling F
V
sd with future improvements by NA62 or KOTO [57]. The axial coupling F
A
sd
is instead tested by searches for Ξ0 → Σ
0 + inv [72], and
the BESIII collaboration will provide an improved bound
via searches for the hyperon decay Λ → n + inv [73].
These are milder than the SN1987A constraint [57, 74],
the observational cooling signal of which can be reduced
by decays of abundant hyperons inside the proto-neutron
star [75–78]. The CLEO collaboration [79] provides the
bound on the vector coupling F
V
cu through searches for
D+ → π
+ + inv, and the BESIII collaboration will improve this constraint by an order of magnitude [73]. The
axial coupling F
A
cu is constrained by D-D¯ mixing [80],
and the LHCb Phase II upgrade will improve such a
bound [81]. Finally, switching to the third generation,
searches by the BaBar collaboration for B+ → π
+ + inv
provide the current bound on the vector coupling F
V
bd [82],
and Belle II will attain an improved sensitivity to F
V
bd
by an order of magnitude [74]. A stringent bound on
the axial coupling F
A
bd arises from the decay channel
Λb → n + inv [72], and Belle II will improve this bound
via B+,0 → ρ
+,0+inv [57]. For couplings between second
and third generations, the BaBar collaboration searches
for B+,0 → K+,0 + inv and B+,0 → K∗+,0 + inv give
the current experimental bound on F
V
bs and F
A
bs, respectively [83]. Belle II will gather a 100 larger integrated
luminosity compared with BarBar, and this will lead to
an order of magnitude enhanced bound on F
V,A
bs [57].
The comprehensive, yet concise, summary illustrated
by Fig. 4 places us in front of the complementarity between terrestrial and cosmological searches for axion FV
interactions. For couplings involving the τ lepton, cosmological data are already more constraining than the
bounds obtained in our laboratories, and this statement
will be true in the future as well once the new experiments become operational. Planck bounds cannot compete at the moment with hadronic experiments, and our
best constraints on hadronic FV couplings are all due
to laboratory searches. Intriguingly, future CMB-S4 will
reach a sensitivity stronger than the ones associated to
future laboratory experiments.
The axion is a hypothetical new particle beyond the
SM motivated from the top-down, and multiple experimental strategies will probe a large fraction of the coupling parameter space in the near future. CMB data provide an additional and complementary strategy to constrain axion couplings, and they are competitive with
other experimental searches for FV couplings. In this
study, we restrict ourselves to a model-independent analysis based on the effective operators in Eq. (1). This
should be thought as the low-energy theory valid at the
energy scale where axion production takes place, which is
typically the mass of the heavier femion appearing in the
interacting vertex. Conceptually, from the high-energy
point of view, these FV interactions can arise both for
theories where flavor is conserved, and in these cases FV
arises from radiative corrections driven by SM couplings,
or for theories where flavor is violated already at the high
PQ scale. Our findings, summarized by Fig. 4, motivate
further studies within UV complete axion models.
