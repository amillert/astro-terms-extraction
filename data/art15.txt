Junction conditions for generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with applications
The generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity is a theory of gravitation that has an action composed of a Lagrangian given by f(R, R), where f is a function of the metric Ricci scalar R and a
new Ricci scalar R formed from a Palatini connection, plus a matter Lagrangian. This theory can
be rewritten by trading the new geometric degrees of freedom that appear in f(R, R) into two scalar
fields, ϕ and ψ, yielding a dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor theory. Given a spacetime theory,
the next important step is to find solutions within it. To construct appropriate solutions it is often
necessary to know the junction conditions between two spacetime regions at a separation hypersurface Σ, with each spacetime region being an independent solution of the theory. The junction
conditions for the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity are found here, both in the geometric
representation and in the scalar-tensor representation, and in addition, for each representation, the
junction conditions for a matching with a thin-shell of matter and for a smooth matching at the
separation hypersurface are worked out. These junction conditions are then applied to three configurations, namely, a star, a quasistar with a black hole, and a wormhole. The star is made of a
Minkowski interior, a thin shell at the interface with all the matter energy conditions being satisfied,
and a Schwarzschild exterior with mass M, and unlike general relativity where the matching can be
performed at any radius rΣ, for this theory the matching can only be performed at a specific value of
the shell radius, namely rΣ =
9M
4
, that corresponds to the general relativistic Buchdahl radius. The
quasistar with a black hole is made of an interior Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a thick
shell that matches smoothly to a mass M Schwarzschild exterior at the light ring radius rΣe = 3M,
and with the matter energy conditions being satisfied for the whole spacetime. The wormhole is
made of some interior with matter that contains the throat, a thin shell at the interface, and a
Schwarzschild-AdS exterior with mass M and negative cosmological constant Λ, with the matter
null energy condition being obeyed everywhere within the wormhole.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Junction conditions in theories of gravitation
and applications
In field theories in general, and in particular in theories of gravitation, one has to find the theory’s junctions
conditions that match, through a matching surface, a solution in a given region to another solution in a neighbor
region. An example is in Newtonian gravitation where,
for a boundary surface it is imposed that the gravitational potential and its first derivatives are continuous
across the surface, and for a surface layer, i.e., an infinitesimally thin shell, it is imposed that the gravitational potential and its first derivatives on the surface are
continuous but its first derivative normal to the surface
is discontinuous yielding in a simple case the shell’s mass
density, the shell’s pressure being then found through the
equation of motion.
General relativity has its own junction conditions. Indeed, to find solutions of the Einstein’s field equations it
is often necessary to match two solutions each defined in
a given region that join at some hypersurface. The whole
spacetime is thus described by two or more regions with

different metrics tensors expressed in different coordinate
systems. The junction conditions in general relativity for
a boundary surface were found by Darmois [1] by imposing that the induced metric across the hypersurface that
separates the two spacetime regions must be continuous,
and in addition the extrinsic curvature of that hypersurface must also be continuous. Lichnerowicz [2] also gave
a set of conditions to have at a junction which are coordinate dependent, see [3] for a comparison between both
sets of conditions. For a surface layer, i.e., a thin-shell,
Lanczos had a first go at this junction condition problem
[4], which was then picked up by Sen that in matching an interior Minkowski to an exterior Schwarzschild
spacetime found, in the context of a thin shell the critical radius that appears in the interior Schwarzschild solution, now called the Buchdahl radius [5]. There were
further developments by Lanczos himself [6] and then
the formalism was definitely closed when Israel put into
a Gauss-Codazzi system of equations [7], showing that if
the extrinsic curvature is not continuous, then the matching between two regions of spacetime can still be done,
but implies the existence of a thin-shell of matter at the
junction radius. The thin shell problem was also studied
in [8], and Taub gave a very general formalism of which
the thin shell fits into [9]. Of course, each theory of gravitation has its own junction conditions which must be deduced from the complete set of field equations. The first
modified theory of gravitation put forward was general
relativity with a cosmological constant term and this thearXiv:2111.12109v1 [gr-qc] 23 Nov 2021

ory has the same junction conditions as general relativity
itself. In several other theories the junction conditions
have been derived. For the Einstein-Cartan theory see
[10], for the Brans-Dicke theory and other scalar-tensor
theories see [11, 12], for Gauss-Bonnet gravity see [13], for
quadratic gravity theories, such as quadratic in the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor or Ricci scalar R, see [14, 15],
for theories with a gravitational Lagrangian density that
is a function f of R, i.e., f (R) theories, without torsion see [16, 17] and with torsion see [18], for the hybrid
metric-Palatini gravity, which is a development of f (R)
theories now with Lagrangian density R + f(R), where
R is a new Ricci scalar derived from a new connection,
see [19], and for another development of f (R) theories,
namely, theories where the Lagrangian density depends
on a function of both R and the trace of the stress-energy
tensor T, i.e., f (R, T) theories, see [20].
The junction conditions have a great many number of
applications as they are used to derive new solutions and
so yield new insights of the corresponding theory of gravitation. In general relativity there are applications to star
solutions without and with thin shells and as models for
black hole mimickers see [21, 22], to gravitational collapse with different interiors and exteriors [23] and gravitational collapse of the Oppenheimer-Snyder in many
different coordinate systems, see e.g., [24], to quasistars,
i.e., matter surrounded a black hole that shines due to
the black hole gravitational field [25], and to wormholes
where junctions between one side of the universe and
the other side can be performed [26, 27]. In EinsteinCartan theory there are applications of junction conditions to spacetimes containing compact objects [28], in
Brans-Dicke theory there are applications to wormhole
solutions [29], in Gauss-Bonnet gravity there are applications of thin shells in brane worlds [30], in quadratic
gravity there are applications to wormholes [31], in f(R)
theories of gravitation there are applications involving
thin shell stars [32], in the hybrid metric-Palatini extension to f(R) gravity theories there are applications to
wormholes [33], and in the other extension to f(R) that
includes the trace of the stress-energy tensor there are
applications to stars [34], to name a few.
B. Junction conditions in the generalized hybrid
metric-Palatini gravity and applications
The generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity is a theory of gravitation that generalizes the hybrid metricPalatini Lagrangian density R+f(R) into a generic function f(R, R) [35], so that the generalized hybrid metricPalatini gravity theory is an extra development of f(R)
gravity theories. The f(R, R) theory can be written in
two representations. One is the geometric representation given by the function f(R, R) itself. The other is
the scalar-tensor representation where some of the degrees of freedom in the function f of the geometric fields
R and R can be traded for two scalar fields, yielding a
dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor theory, in the same
manner as the f (R) theory can be rewritten as a dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor theory with one scalar field.
The generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity has very
interesting features and has been studied in the context of
cosmological solutions [36], wormholes [37], scalar modes.
[38], dynamical systems [39], stability of Kerr black holes
[40], cosmic strings [41], thick-brane structures [42], singularities in cosmological models [43], weak-field regime
[44], and double layers applied to wormholes [45]. Junction conditions must be found for any theory of gravitation, including the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini
gravity.
In this work, we deduce the junction conditions of the
generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. We display
these conditions in both the geometrical and the scalartensor representations. For each representation the junction conditions for a matching with a thin-shell of matter
and for a smooth matching at the separation hypersurface are worked out. We show three applications: stars,
quasistars with black holes, and wormholes.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we display
de action of the theory and the field equations both in
the geometrical and in the scalar-tensor representations.
In Sec. III, we obtain the sets of junction conditions in
the geometrical and in the scalar-tensor representations
and in each representation we give the conditions for thin
shell matching and for smooth matching. In Sec. IV,
we present the junction conditions for static spherically
symmetric spacetimes. In Sec. V, the first application of
the junction conditions is made to a star thin shell, more
precisely, for an inner Minkowski spacetime, a thin shell
in the middle, and an outer Schwarzschild spacetime. In
Sec. VI, the second application is made to a quasistar
with a black hole, it is an application involving smooth
matching, an inner Schwarzschild black hole, a mild thin
shell at the inner junction, followed by a thick shell that
matches smoothly into an outer Schwarzschild vacuum
spacetime. In Sec. VII, the third application is presented,
to a wormhole involving a thin shell and an outer AdS
spacetime. In Sec. VIII, we conclude. The Appendices B
and C are used as auxiliary tools to the main text.

These results allow us to expand the terms with derivatives of fR or fR in Eq. (2) and write them as derivatives
of either R or R. We do not write the resultant equation
here due to its size, it can be found in Appendix A.
B. Equations of the scalar representation of the
theory
It is sometimes useful to express the action (1) in
a scalar-tensor representation. This can be achieved
by considering an action with two auxiliary fields,
α and β, respectively, in the following form S =
1

Therefore, we can define two scalar fields as ϕ =

convention. The equivalent action is of the form S =

the potential V (ϕ, ψ) as V (ϕ, ψ) = −f (α, β)+ϕα−ψβ.
Taking into account that ˆgab is conformally related to gab
through the relation ˆgab = fR gab, and that it can now be
written as ˆgab = −ψ gab, we have that the Ricci scalars R

III. JUNCTION CONDITIONS FOR THE
GENERALIZED HYBRID METRIC-PALATINI
GRAVITY THEORY
A. Junction conditions for the geometrical
representation of the theory
1. Matching with a thin-shell at Σ
Let us denote the whole four-dimensional spacetime
by V, which is divided by a hypersurface Σ into two regions, V
+ and V
−. We denote the metric g
+
ab, given in
coordinates x
a
+, as the metric in region V
+, and the metric g
−
ab, given in coordinates x
a
−, as the metric in region
V
−, with latin indices running from 0 to 3, 0 being in
general a time index. In both sides of Σ, we define a
set of coordinates y
α, with greek indices running from
0 to 2, or some other combination of three indices out
of the four latin indices. We define the projection vectors from the four-dimensional regions V
+ and V
−, to
the three-dimensional hypersurface Σ as e
a
α =
∂xa
∂yα . The
unit normal vector n
a
to Σ is defined to point in the
direction from V
− to V
+. We denote by l the proper distance or proper time along the geodesics perpendicular
to Σ. The parameter l is chosen equal to zero at Σ, is
positive in the region V
+, and is negative in the region
V
−. The infinitesimal displacement along the geodesics
is dxa = n
adl, with l parameterizing the geodesic and
the normal na is here given by na = ∂al, with  being
either −1 or +1 for n
a a timelike or spacelike vector, respectively, so na satisfies n
ana = . To match the two
regions V
+ and V
− through a hypersurface Σ, the distribution function formalism is in general needed, so we
define Θ (l) as the Heaviside distribution function, and
δ (l) = ∂lΘ (l) as the Dirac distribution function. For a
quantity X, we write X = X+Θ (l) + X−Θ (−l), where
the index + indicates that the quantity X+ is the value
of the quantity X in the region V
+, and the index − indicates that the quantity X− is the value of the quantity
X in the region V
−. The jump of X across Σ is denoted
by [X] = X+|Σ − X−|Σ. The normal n
a and the tangent
vector e
a
α to Σ have zero jump by definition, i.e., [n
a
] = 0
and [e
a
α] = 0.
We now derive the junction conditions for the geometrical representation of the generalized hybrid metricPalatini gravity. We deal with gab to start with and only
after with Γˆa
bc. We consider the general case for which a
thin-shell arises at the matching hypersurface.
Let us start with gab. To have a spacetime with a line
element, and so a metric gab, this has to be properly defined throughout the spacetime. In particular, the metric
must have some form of continuity. In the distribution
formalism, one writes the metric gab as
gab = g
+
abΘ(l) + g
−
abΘ(−l). (9)
The derivative of gab is ∂cgab = (∂cg
+
ab)Θ(l) +
(∂cg
−
ab)Θ(−l) +  [gab] ncδ(l). The term proportional
to δ (l) is problematic, because the Christoffel symbols
corresponding to it would have products of the form
Θ (l) δ (l) which are not defined in the distribution formalism. Therefore one has to impose [gab] = 0. Moreover, generically gab induces a metric on Σ which is given
hαβ = gabe
a
αe
b
β
, such that from the exterior the induced
metric is h
+
αβ = g
+
abe
a
αe
b
β
and from the interior the induced metric is h
−
αβ = g
−
abe
a
αe
b
β
. So, for hαβ to give a
continuous metric on Σ we must have h
+
αβ − h
−
αβ = 0,
i.e.,
[hαβ] = 0. (10)
This junction condition is the same as the first junction condition in general relativity, and also should hold
generically for many theories of gravitation. Then the
derivative of the metric is now
∂cgab = (∂cg
+
ab)Θ(l) + (∂cg
−
ab)Θ(−l). (11)
Now, let us analyze the further junction conditions related to gab that arise in the theory. Notice that Eq. (2)
depends directly on the function f, which can be any
general function of R and R. This means that, in
general, there will be terms in f that are power-laws
or products of R and R. When we write these terms
as distribution functions, extra junction conditions will
arise in order to prevent the appearance of terms of the
form Θ (l) δ (l), undefined in the distribution formalism.
Let us analyze first the zero order derivative term, R.
In general, the Ricci tensor Rab of the metric gab can
be written in terms of distribution functions as Rab =
R
+
abΘ (l) + R
−
abΘ (−l) −

 eα


δ (l),
where Kαβ = ∇αnβ is the extrinsic curvature of Σ with
nβ = e
b
βnb, and K = Kα
α is the trace of Kαβ. The Ricci
scalar is then R = R+Θ (l) + R−Θ (−l) − 2 [K] δ (l). To
avoid the presence of singular terms of the form δ (l)
2
in
the products between Ricci scalars, say, in the function
f, a junction condition arising from this analysis is
[K] = 0. (12)
This condition does not appear in general relativity. Using Eq. (12) the Ricci tensor is
Rab = R
+
abΘ (l) + R
−
abΘ (−l) −  [Kab] δ (l) , (13)
and the Ricci scalar is now
R = R
+Θ (l) + R
−Θ (−l) . (14)
Let us analyze now the first order derivative term ∂aR.
Computing the partial derivatives of R expressed in
Eq. (14) leads to ∂aR = ∂aR+Θ (l) + ∂aR−Θ (−l) +
 [R] naδ (l). In the field equations in Eq. (2), we can see
that due to the existence of the term ∂afR∂bfR, there
will be terms depending on products of these derivatives,
such as ∂
cR∂cR. Given the terms that appear in ∂aR
these products would depend on δ (l)
2
, which are singula
5
terms, or on Θ (l) δ (l), which are undefined. Therefore,
to avoid the presence of these terms we obtain a junction
condition for R as
[R] = 0, (15)
Then ∂aR can be written as
∂aR = ∂aR
+Θ (l) + ∂aR
−Θ (−l) . (16)
Form Eq. (15) we see that R must be continuous across
the hypersurface Σ. We then denote the value of R at Σ
as RΣ.
Let us now turn to the independent connection Γ. As ˆ
we have seen, the Palatini Ricci tensor Rab is written in
terms of Γ and its derivatives, ˆ Rab = ∂cΓˆc
ab − ∂bΓˆc
ac +
Γˆc
cdΓˆd
ab − Γˆc
adΓˆd
cb. Consequently, the Palatini Ricci scalar
R will also depend on Γ in the same way. As ˆ R is generally present in the field equations through the function f (R, R) and its derivatives, extra junction conditions will arise from Γ. Being a fundamental field of the ˆ
theory, Γ can be written in the distribution formalism as ˆ
Γˆc
ab = Γˆc+
ab Θ (l) + Γˆc−
ab Θ (−l) , (17)
where δ terms are not present to avoid the presence
of undefined terms. Defining the extrinsic curvature
written in terms of the independent connection Γ as ˆ
Kab = e
α
a
e
β
b ∇ˆ
αnβ, where ∇ˆ is the covariant derivative
on the boundary with respect to Γ, the trace of ˆ Kab as
K, and following the previous arguments for Rab and R
that led Eq. (12), we obtain
[K] = 0 . (18)
Then, the Ricci tensor is
Rab = R
+
abΘ (l) + R
−
abΘ (−l) −  [Kab] δ (l) . (19)
and with the help of Eq. (18) the corresponding Ricci
scalar is
R = R+Θ (l) + R−Θ (−l). (20)
Let us now work with ∂aR. Computing the partial
derivatives of R expressed in Eq. (20) leads to ∂aR =
∂aR+Θ (l)+∂aR−Θ (−l)+δ (l) [R] na. In the field equations in Eq. (2), we can see that due to the existence of
the term ∂afR∂bfR, there will be terms depending on
products of these derivatives, such as ∂
cR∂cR. Given the
terms that appear in ∂aR, again these products would depend on δ (l)
2
, which are singular terms, or on Θ (l) δ (l),
which are undefined. Therefore, to avoid the presence of
these terms we obtain the junction conditions for R as
[R] = 0. (21)
Then ∂aR can be written as
∂aR = ∂aR+Θ (l) + ∂aR−Θ (−l) . (22)
Form Eq. (21) we see that R must be continuous across
the hypersurface Σ. We then denote the value of R at Σ
as RΣ. Clearly, Eqs. (15) and (21), imply that the terms
with first derivatives of R and R, see Eqs. (16) and (22)
are regular.
We now turn to the jumps of the derivatives of R
and R. These jumps are not independent of each other,
and the relationship between them can be obtained from
Eq. (3). To find this relationship, let us first write the second order derivatives of R and R, i.e., the terms ∇a∇bR,
R, ∇a∇bR, and R, in the distribution formalism.
The second order term ∇a∇bR can be generically written
in the distribution formalism as
∇a∇bR = ∇a∇bR+Θ (l) + ∇a∇bR−Θ (−l) +
na [∂bR] δ (l) , (23)
and then R = R+Θ (l) + R−Θ (−l) + n
a
[∂aR] δ (l).
Likewise, the second order term ∇a∇bR can be generically written in the distribution formalism as
∇a∇bR = ∇a∇bR+Θ (l) + ∇a∇bR−Θ (−l) +
na [∂bR] δ (l) , (24)
and then, R = R+Θ (l)+R−Θ (−l)+na
[∂aR] δ (l).
Taking the trace of Eq. (3) written in terms of the distribution functions and using the expansions given in
Eqs. (23) and (24) for the second order derivatives, one
obtains
fRRn
a
[∂aR] + fRRn
a
[∂aR] = 0 , (25)
which is the equation that relates the jumps of the derivatives of R and R.
Given the second order derivatives of R and R, in the
distribution formalism, see Eqs. (23) and (24), the lefthand side of the field equation in Eq. (2) thus depends
on terms proportional to the delta function δ (l). These
terms are associated with the presence of a thin-shell at
the separation hypersurface Σ. To find the properties
of the thin shell, i.e., the stress-energy tensor for this
hypersurface, let us write the stress-energy tensor in the
geometrical representation Tgrab, which we write simply
as Tab to shorten the notation, as a distribution function
of the form
Tab = T
+
abΘ (l) + T
−
abΘ (−l) + δ (l) Sab, (26)
where T
+
ab is the stress-energy tensor in the geometrical
representation in the region V

ab is the stress-energy
tensor in the geometrical representation in the region V

and where Sab is the 4-dimensional stress-energy tensor
of the thin shell in the geometrical representation, which
can be written as a 3-dimensional tensor at Σ as
Sab = Sαβe

With these considerations, the δ (l) terms in

Eq. (25). Inserting Eq. (25) into the expression just

Several remarks should be done. Note that the trace
of the extrinsic curvature K can be written in terms of
the trace of the extrinsic curvature K and the conformal
factor fR as K = K + n
c∂cfR/fR. The conformal factor
fR (R, R) is a function of only R and R, and both these
variables must be continuous to satisfy their own junction
conditions in Eqs. (15) and (21). Consequently, we have
[fR (R, R)] = 0. Thus, taking the jump of K, expanding ∂cfR in terms of ∂cR and ∂cR, and using Eqs. (12)
and (25), we recover Eq. (18). Thus, these two junction
conditions are also not independent.
To conclude, the full set of independent junction conditions of the theory in the geometrical representation for
a matching with a shell is thus
[hαβ] = 0 ,
[K] = 0 ,
[R] = 0 , (29)

2. Matching smoothly at Σ
We have obtained the junction conditions for which
two spacetimes, V
+ and V
−, can be matched at a given
separation hypersurface Σ with the presence of a thinshell at Σ described by a surface stress-energy tensor S
β
α.
If S
β
α vanishes, the matching between the two spacetimes
is smooth, i.e., without the need for a thin shell at the
separation hypersurface. A smooth matching between
V
+ and V
− can be achieved by imposing another set of
conditions on the geometrical variables. Indeed, the presence of the thin-shell is associated with the term in the
stress-energy tensor proportional to δ (l) when written in
the distribution formalism, which is then reflected in the
field equations.
For a smooth matching, i.e., for a matching without
a thin-shell, one must guarantee that the terms proportional to δ (l) vanish. Let us now derive the conditions
for such to happen in the geometrical representation of
the theory.
The form of the metric for the whole spacetime as given
in Eq. (9) is still valid for a smooth matching, so following
the same procedure we have again that hαβ, the induced
metric on Σ, has no jump,
[hαβ] = 0. (30)
Now, the Ricci tensor Rab of the metric gab can be written
in terms of distribution functions as Rab = R

and K = Kα
α is the trace of Kαβ. But the field equation
Eq. (2) has an Rab term and so in general it would possess
a term proportional to δ (l) which cannot be present for
a smooth matching. To avoid the presence of this term
in the field equation Eq. (2), one must impose that the
jump of the extrinsic curvature Kab = e

R
+
abΘ (l)+R
−
abΘ (−l), and thus R = R+Θ (l)+R−Θ (−l).
As we have done previously, computing then the partial derivatives of R one finds ∂aR+Θ (l)+∂aR−Θ (−l)+
 [R] naδ (l), which when put into the terms ∂afR∂bfR in
the field equation, Eq. (2), gives rise to terms depending on products of these derivatives, such as ∂
cR∂cR,
which are singular terms, or on Θ (l) δ (l), which are undefined, and cannot be present in any matching, including a smooth matching, and so this leads to
[R] = 0, (32)
From Eq. (32) we see that R must be continuous across
the hypersurface Σ. We then denote the value of R at
Σ as RΣ. Also from Eq. (32) one finds that ∂aR can be
written as ∂aR = ∂aR+Θ (l) + ∂aR−Θ (−l)

the trace of Kαβ.
Let us now look at Eq. (2) again. We have already
concluded that the term Rab does not have any terms
proportional to δ (l) and also for a smooth matching Tab
cannot have terms proportional to δ (l). Thus, the the
differential terms on fR in Eq. (2) cannot have terms
proportional to δ (l). Then, from Eq. (3) it is clear 
7
generically Rab cannot have a term proportional to δ (l).
Thus, the jump of the extrinsic curvature Kab = e

b Kαβ
must vanish, i.e., one obtains the following junction condition,
[Kαβ] = 0. (33)
Since [Kαβ] = 0 it implies directly that its trace vanishes, [K] = 0. Moreover [Kαβ] = 0 implies that Rab =
R
+
abΘ (l)+R
−
abΘ (−l), and thus R = R+Θ (l)+R−Θ (−l).
As we have done previously, computing then the partial
derivatives of R one finds ∂aR+Θ (l) + ∂aR−Θ (−l) +
 [R] naδ (l), which when put in the field equations into
the terms ∂afR∂bfR in the field equation, Eq. (2), gives
rise to terms depending on products of these derivatives, such as ∂
cR∂cR, which are singular terms, or on
Θ (l) δ (l), which are undefined, and cannot be present in
any matching, including a smooth matching, and so this
leads to
[R] = 0, (34)
From Eq. (34) we see that R must be continuous across
the hypersurface Σ. We then denote the value of R at
Σ as RΣ. Also from Eq. (34) one finds that ∂aR can be
written as ∂aR = ∂aR+Θ (l) + ∂aR−Θ (−l).
Furthermore, due to the presence of the second-order
derivative terms ∇a∇bfX and fX in Eq. (2), there
will be second-order derivative terms of both R and
R in the field equations. These second-order derivatives are ∇a∇bR = ∇a∇bR+Θ (l) + ∇a∇bR−Θ (−l) +
na [∂bR] δ (l) and R = R+Θ (l) + R−Θ (−l) +
n
a
[∂aR] δ (l), see Eq. (23) and the one following it, and
the same expressions for ∇a∇bR and R, see Eq. (24)
and the one following it, and they have terms proportional to δ (l). To avoid the presence of these terms in
order to have a smooth matching, on has to impose that
the jump of the first-order derivatives of R and R vanish,
i.e., we obtain the two following junction conditions
[∂aR] = 0, (35)
[∂aR] = 0. (36)
Several remarks should be done. Note that the extrinsic curvature Kαβ can be written in terms of the extrinsic curvature Kαβ and the conformal factor fR as Kαβ =
Kαβ−Xc

The conformal factor fR (R, R) is a function of only R
and R, and both these variables must be continuous to
satisfy their own junction conditions in Eqs. (32) and
(34). Consequently, we have [fR (R, R)] = 0. Thus, taking the jump of Kαβ, expanding ∂cfR in terms of ∂cR
and ∂cR, and using Eqs. (30), (35) and (36), we recover
Eq. (31). Thus, these two junction conditions are not
independent.
To conclude, the full set of independent junction conditions of the theory in the geometrical representation for
a smooth matching is thus
[hαβ] = 0 ,

Kβ

[R] = 0 , (37)

of extra junction conditions can be obtained from the
general set in Eq. (29) by setting Sαβ = 0. In this case,
since the factors depending on derivatives of the function
f are generally nonzero, putting the second equation into
the trace of the fifth equation of Eq. (29) yields the fifth
equation of Eq. (37), which on putting it back into the
fifth equation of Eq. (29) yields the second equation of
Eq. (37). Note in addition that in the case that f (R, R)
reduces to an f(R) theory the fourth and sixth equations
of Eq. (37) are identically zero.
B. Junction conditions for the scalar-tensor
representation of the theory
1. Matching with a thin-shell at Σ
The nomenclature is the same as previously. V
+ and
V
− are two regions of a four-dimensional spacetime V
separated by a hypersurface Σ. The metrics in each region are g
+
ab and g
−
ab, respectively, the projection vectors
at Σ are e
a
α and the normal to Σ is na. The distribution
functions needed are Heaviside function and the Dirac
function. As before, [X] = X+|Σ − X−|Σ denotes the
jump of X across Σ.
We now derive the junction conditions for the scalartensor representation of the generalized hybrid metricPalatini gravity. We deal with gab to start with and only
after we deal with the scalar fields ϕ and ψ. Some equations are the same as in the geometrical representation
of the theory, but since they arise now in the context of
the scalar-tensor representation we also write them here
to be complete and self-contained.
Let us start with gab. First of all, note that in the
field equations given by Eq. (6), there is only one term
that depends on derivatives of the metric gab, which is
the Einstein’s tensor Gab. Thus, the same reasoning as
outlined in Sec.III A 1 can be followed, i.e., we write the
metric in the distribution formalism as
gab = g
+
abΘ (l) + g
−
abΘ (−l). (38)
The derivative of gab becomes ∂cgab = (∂cg
+
ab)Θ(l) +
(∂cg
−
ab)Θ(−l) +  [gab] ncδ(l), where the term proportional to δ (l) is problematic, because the correspondent Christoffel symbols would have products of the
form Θ (l) δ (l) which are undefined in the distribution
formalism. Therefore one has to impose [gab] = 0.
8
Moreover, as gab induces a metric on Σ which is given
hαβ = gabe
a
αe

, such that from the exterior the induced
metric is h

αβ = g

. Consequently, for hαβ to give
a continuous metric on Σ we must have h
+
αβ − h
−
αβ = 0,
i.e.,
[hαβ] = 0. (39)
Again this is the same as the first junction condition in
general relativity and should generally hold in numerous
theories of gravity. The derivative of the metric thus
becomes
∂cgab = (∂cg
+
ab)Θ(l) + (∂cg
−
ab)Θ(−l). (40)
The Ricci tensor Rab of the metric gab written in the distribution formalism is then Rab = R

δ (l), and consequently the Ricci
scalar R is R = R+Θ (l) + R−Θ (−l) − 2 [K] δ (l), where
Kαβ = ∇αnβ is the extrinsic curvature of Σ with nβ =
e
b
βnb, and K = Kα
α is the trace of Kαβ, which will be
used further down.
We now turn to the scalar fields ϕ and ψ. We start by
writing the two scalar fields in the distribution formalism
in the usual way as
ϕ = ϕ
+Θ (l) + ϕ
−Θ (−l) , (41)
ψ = ψ
+Θ (l) + ψ
−Θ (−l) . (42)
The derivatives of the scalar fields in this distribution
representation are of the form ∂aϕ = ∂aϕ
+Θ (l) +
∂aϕ
−Θ (−l) + δ (l) [ϕ] na, and ∂aψ = ∂aψ
+Θ (l) +
∂aψ
−Θ (−l) + δ (l) [ψ] na. Note that in the field equations given by Eq. (6), there are terms that depend on
products of derivatives of the scalar field, such as ∂
cϕ∂cϕ
or ∂
cψ∂cψ. These products would have terms depending
δ (l)
2
, which are divergent, or terms of the form Θ (l) δ (l),
which are undefined. Therefore, to avoid the presence of
these terms, one has to impose the following junction
conditions for the scalar fields
[ϕ] = 0, (43)
[ψ] = 0, (44)
i.e., the scalar fields must be continuous across the hypersurface Σ. Then, let us define the value of the scalar fields
at Σ to be ϕΣ and ψΣ. Now, using Eqs. (43) and (44)
we verify that the terms ∂
cϕ∂cϕ and ∂aϕ∂bϕ or ∂
cψ∂cψ
and ∂aψ∂bψ in Eq. (6) become regular.
Let us now consider the second-order derivative terms
of the scalar fields, i.e, the terms of the form ∇a∇bϕ or
∇a∇bψ. In the distribution formalism, for the scalar field
ϕ these terms become
∇a∇bϕ = ∇a∇bϕ+Θ (l)+∇a∇bϕ−Θ (−l)+δ (l) na [∂bϕ] ,
(45)
and thus we have ϕ = ϕ+Θ (l) + ϕ−Θ (−l) +
δ (l) n
a
[∂aϕ]. Likewise, for the scalar field ψ we obtain
∇a∇bψ = ∇a∇bψ+Θ (l)+∇a∇bψ−Θ (−l)+δ (l) na [∂bψ] ,
(46)
and also ψ = ψ+Θ (l) + ψ−Θ (−l) + δ (l) n
a
[∂aψ].
Now we deal with a thin shell that might appear. The
second-order derivative terms of ϕ and ψ will thus contribute with terms proportional to δ (l) in the left-hand
side of Eq. (6). These terms are associated with the presence of a thin-shell at the separation hypersurface Σ. To
find the properties of this thin-shell, i.e., to obtain its
stress-energy tensor, we write the stress-energy tensor
in the scalar-tensor representation Tsrab, which we write
simply as Tab to shorten the notation, as a distribution
function of the form
Tab = T
+
abΘ (l) + T
−
abΘ (−l) + δ (l) Sab, (47)
where T
+
ab is the stress-energy tensor in the scalar-tensor
representation in the region V
+, T
−
ab is the stress-energy
tensor in the scalar-tensor representation in the region
V
−, and where Sab is the 4-dimensional stress-energy tensor of the thin shell in the scalar-tensor representation,
which can again be written as a 3-dimensional tensor at
Σ as
Sab = Sαβe
α
a
e
β
b
. (48)
Using these considerations, the δ (l) factors of the modified field equations given by Eq. (6) at the hypersurface
Σ can be written as 8πSαβ = hαβn
c
([∂cϕ] − [∂cψ]) −
(ϕΣ − ψΣ)  ([Kαβ] − [K] hαβ), where Kαβ is the extrinsic curvature and K = Kα

[∂aψ] = 0 . (50)
Inserting then Eqs. (49) and (50) into the field
Eq. (6), we obtain − (ϕΣ − ψΣ) ([Kαβ] − hαβ [K]) =

. Tracing this result with the inverse
induced metric h
αβ cancels out the terms depending on
Sαβ and we obtain
[K] = 0 . (51)
i.e., the extrinsic curvature Kαβ does not need to be
continuous at the hypersurface Σ but it must at least
have a continuous trace across Σ. Inserting Eq. (51)
into the expression for Sαβ, i.e., hαβn

should be done. Equation (52) supersedes Eq. (49). Indeed, putting Eq. (51) into the trace of Eq. (52) yields
Eq. (49). So this latter is not independent of Eq. (52).
To conclude, the full set of junction conditions of the
generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity in the scalartensor representation for a matching with a thin shell is
thus
[hαβ] = 0,
[K] = 0,
[ϕ] = 0,

conditions as the geometrical representation, as expected
from the equivalence between the two representations.
2. Smooth matching at Σ
We have obtained the junction conditions for which
two spacetimes, V
+ and V
−, can be matched at a given
separation hypersurface Σ with the presence of a thinshell at Σ. We now turn to the case of a smooth matching.
For a smooth matching between V
+ and V
−, i.e., for a
matching without a thin-shell, one must guarantee that
the terms proportional to δ (l) vanish. Let us now derive
the conditions for such to happen in the scalar-tensor
representation of the theory.
The metric gab can still be written in the same for as in
Eq. (38) for the smooth matching case. Thus, following
the same arguments presented in the previous section, we
conclude again that the induced metric hαβ on Σ must
be continuous, i.e.,
[hαβ] = 0. (54)
Now, the Ricci tensor Rab of the metric gab can be written
in terms of distribution functions as Rab = R

and K = Kα
α is the trace of Kαβ. But the field equation
Eq. (6) has an Rab term and so in general it would possess
a term proportional to δ (l) which cannot be present for
a smooth matching. To avoid the presence of this term
in the field equation Eq. (6), one must impose that the
jump of the extrinsic curvature Kab = e
α
a
e
β
b Kαβ must
vanish, i.e., one obtains the following junction condition,
[Kαβ] = 0. (55)
Since [Kαβ] = 0 it implies directly that its trace vanishes,
[K] = 0.
Furthermore, the same forms of the scalar fields ϕ
and ψ written in the distribution formalism in Eqs. (41)
and (42) are also still valid in the smooth matching case.
Consequently, following the reasoning presented in the
previous section, we derive that both scalar fields must
be continuous across Σ, i.e.,
[ϕ] = 0 . (56)
[ψ] = 0 . (57)
Accordingly, the second-order derivative terms of the
scalar fields ϕ and ψ are given by the same expressions as
before, i.e., as represented in Eqs. (45) and (46). These
derivatives have terms proportional to δ (l), which can
not be present in a smooth matching. Consequently, to
avoid the presence of these terms in the field equation
Eq. (6) and the scalar field equations of motion in Eqs. (7)
and (8), one must impose that the partial derivatives of
ϕ and ψ are continuous across the hypersurface Σ, thus
having the two junction conditions
[∂aϕ] = 0 , (58)
[∂aψ] = 0 . (59)
To conclude, the full set of junction conditions of the
theory for a smooth matching in the scalar-tensor representation is
[hαβ] = 0,

Kβ
α

= 0,
[ϕ] = 0, (60)
[ψ] = 0,
[∂aϕ] = 0,
[∂aψ] = 0,
so composed of six equations. Note that the same set
of equations could be obtained from Eqs. (53) by setting
Sαβ = 0 and S = 0. In this case, the second equation
together with the trace of the fifth equation of Eq. (53)
enforces the fifth equation of Eq. (60), which upon replacement back into the fifth equation of Eq. (53) then
yields the second equation of Eq. (60), and one recovers
the same set of junction conditions.
IV. JUNCTION CONDITIONS FOR THE
GENERALIZED HYBRID METRIC-PALATINI
GRAVITY THEORY FOR STATIC
SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC SPACETIMES
A. Geometrical representation
1. Matching with a thin-shell
In the geometrical representation, let us assume a
static spherically symmetric spacetime with an interior
10
an exterior and a thin spherical shell at the junction between the two with an stress-energy tensor Sgr α
β
. The
first five matching conditions in the thin shell case given
in Eq. (29) still hold, namely, [hαβ] = 0, [K] = 0 [R] = 0
[R] = 0, and fRRn
a
[∂aR] + fRRn
a
[∂aR] = 0. Now, the
spacetime is represented by the time t, and the spatial
spherical coordinates, the radial coordinate r, and the
angles θ and φ. The stress-energy tensor Sgr α
β
, which
we write simply as S
β
α to shorten the notation, at the
thin shell of radius rΣ, can be written as a perfect fluid
stress-energy tensor, i.e.,
S
β
α = diag (−σ, p, p) , (61)
where σ is the surface density of the thin shell and p is
the transverse pressure on the thin shell. The trace of
the extrinsic curvature on a spherical thin shell is K =
Kα
α = K0
0 + Kθ
θ + K
φ
φ
, and since Kθ
θ = K
φ
φ
, it can be put
as K = K0
0 +2Kθ
θ
. Now, the second junction condition in
Eq. (29) is [K] = 0, so that for a spherically symmetric
thin shell it holds that
K0
0

= −2

Kθ
θ

. Then the last
equation of Eq. (29) has two components, corresponding
to S
0
0 = −σ and S
θ
θ = p, so that it reduces to

at rΣ. This is the thin shell equation for a spherically

have to hold also.
2. Smooth matching
If there is no shell then σ = 0 and p = 0. From
Eqs. (62) and (63), we can see that if
K0
0

= 0 and
[∂cR] = 0, we recover σ = 0 and p = 0. Since [K] = 0,
we have that

= 0, and thus we
conclude that the jump of the extrinsic curvature vanishes identically, i.e., [Kαβ] = 0. The other equations in
Eq. (37) have to hold also.
B. Scalar-tensor representation
1. Matching with a thin-shell
In the scalar representation, the stress-energy tensor
Ssr α
β
, which we write simply as S
β
α to shorten the notation, is a diagonal matrix which can be written as
S
β
α = diag (−σ, p, p) , (64)
where again σ is the surface density of the thin shell
and p is the transverse pressure on the thin shell. Using this representation and noticing that, since [K] =
0, the angular components of
Kβ
α

are the same and

K0

at rΣ. Note that this result is equivalent to the one obtained in the geometrical representation of the theory.
Indeed, when we map back ϕ = fR, use Eq. (4) to expand
the partial derivatives of fR, and use Eq. (25) to relate
the partial derivatives of R and R, we recover Eqs. (62)
and (63). The other equations in Eq. (53) have to hold
also.
2. Smooth matching
If there is no shell then σ = 0 and p = 0. From
Eqs. (65) and (66), we can see that if

[∂aϕ] = 0, we recover σ = 0 and p = 0. Since [K] = 0,

V. FIRST APPLICATION: A STAR. THIN
SHELL: MATCHING AN INTERIOR
MINKOWSKI SPACETIME TO AN EXTERIOR
SCHWARZSCHILD SPACETIME
A. Geometrical representation
1. The theory and the configuration
The first step is to choose a theory, i.e., a form for the
function f (R, R). In this case, we chose
f (R, R) = R + R +
RR
R0
. (67)
For this particular form of the function f, the first and
second derivatives fR, fR, fRR, fRR and fRR become
fR = 1+R¯, fR = 1+R¯, fRR = fRR = 0, fRR =
1
R0
.
See the Appendix B for the rationale of the choice of
Eq. (67).
The configuration for which we want to find a solution
is a star shell. It is our first application of the use of the
junction conditions for the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity
11
theory derived above to match two different spacetimes
with a thin shell in between. The interior is a Minkowski
spacetime and the exterior is a Schwarzschild spacetime.
2. The interior and the exterior solutions
Considering the interior as the Minkowski spacetime
and the exterior as the Schwarzschild spacetime we note
that both these spacetimes are solutions of the modified field equations in vacuum with Tab = 0. Both the
Minkowski and the Schwarzschild solutions have a vanishing Ricci tensor Rab = 0 and, consequently, a vanishing Ricci scalar R = 0. Inserting the form of f (R, R)
given in Eq. (67) and its appropriate derivatives into
Eq. (2), one obtains that Rab = 0, and thus R = 0. This
means that the function f (R, R) vanishes both in the
interior and the exterior solutions. Thus the interior and
exterior spacetimes are characterized by the Minkowski
and the Schwarzschild line elements, respectively, and by
a function f given by f (R, R) = 0.
In the usual spherical coordinates (t, r, θ, φ) we can
write for the interior
ds2
i = −dt2+dr2+r
2

, f (Ri
, Ri) = 0 , 0 ≤ r ≤ rΣ ,
(68)
where the subscript i denotes interior, with dΩ
2 = dθ2 +
sin2
θdφ2 being the line element over the unit sphere,
rΣ being the boundary radius between the interior and
the exterior, and we have not put a subscript i in the
coordinates to not overcrowd the notation. Note that
from this point onwards we will use the subscript i for
the interior region instead of the subscript - that we have
used for the general formalism.
In the same spherical coordinates we can write for the
exterior

where the subscript e denotes exterior, M is the
Schwarzschild mass, and α is a dimensionless constant
that guarantees that the interior and exterior time coordinates are the same, and we have not put a subscript e
in the coordinates to not overcrowd the notation. Note
that from this point onwards we will use the subscript e
for the interior region instead of the subscript + that we
have used for the general formalism.
3. The matching with a thin shell
Let us now apply the junction conditions given in
Eq. (29), see also Eqs. (62) and (63), to perform a matching between these two spacetimes.
The first junction condition in Eq. (29), [hαβ] = 0, sets
the expression for the constant α as α =

1 −
2M
rΣ
−1
where rΣ is the radius at which we perform the matching.
The second junction condition of Eq. (29), [K] = 0,
has to be worked carefully. Using the metrics in Eqs. (68)
and (69), one verifies that for a matching performed at
radius rΣ we have
K0

. The trace of the extrinsic curvature
on a spherical thin shell is K = Kα
α = K0

and since Kθ
θ = K
φ
φ
, it can be put as K = K0
0 + 2Kθ

.
So, taking the trace, we obtain [K] = −
2
r −
3M−2r
r

√

and thus this junction condition becomes effectively a
constraint on the radius rΣ at which the matching must
be performed, namely, −
2
r −
3M−2r
r
2
√
1− 2M
r
= 0. Solving this
constraint for rΣ yields
rΣ =

4
M. (70)
Thus α above has the value α = 9. Here there is a
difference between general relativity and the generalized
hybrid metric-Palatini gravity and it is also a feature of
other f (R) theories. In general relativity, the matching between these two spacetimes could be performed for
any value of the radial coordinate as long as rΣ > 2M,
i.e., rΣ is larger than the gravitational radius of the
Schwarzschild solution. However, in here we are forced
to perform the matching at a specific value of r to satisfy
the extra [K] = 0 junction condition. Note that 9
4M in
Eq. (70) corresponds to the Buchdahl limit for compactness of a fluid star. In general relativity, the same limit
arises for thin-shells with surface density σ and pressure
p if one imposes that the equation of state for the matter in the thin shell obeys 2p ≤ σ, with the Buchdahl
limit arising when the inequality is saturated. In the context of thin shells in general relativity the radius given
in Eq. (70) was first found in [5].
The third junction condition of Eq. (29) is [R] = 0.
Both metrics in Eqs. (68) and (69) have an identically
vanishing Ricci tensor, i.e., Rab = 0. As a consequence,
they both have a vanishing Ricci scalar R = 0 and thus
the condition [R] = 0 is automatically satisfied.
The fourth junction condition of Eq.(29) is [R] = 0,
and as we have seen, for a f (R, R) as given in Eq. (67),
when Rab = 0 one has Rab = 0, and consequently R = 0,
for both metrics inside and outside. Thus, the condition
[R] = 0 is also automatically satisfied.

more elaborated and we need to dwell on it. Indeed, notice that the jump in the extrinsic curvature [Kab] is not
zero, and thus we need a thin shell at r = RΣ to perform
the matching. Let us now study the stress-energy tensor
of this thin shell. Following the analysis from Sec. IV A 1,
the energy density σ and the pressure p of the thin-shell
are given by Eqs. (62) and (63). From these two equations we obtain for our specific case, i.e., for an f (R, R)
as given in Eq. (67) together with its derivatives, usin

following surface energy density σ and surface pressure

σ =

27πM

p =

27πM
. (72)
From these equations, one has the equation of state
σ = 2p. Since both σ and p are positive and σ = 2p, all
the energy conditions, namely, the null energy condition
(NEC), the weak energy condition (WEC), the dominant
energy condition (DEC), and the strong energy condition
(SEC) are satisfied at the shell. Note also that in general relativity a shell with σ = 2p has to be matched at
the Buchdahl radius rΣ =
9
4M. The difference from the
generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity to general relativity, is that in the former the matching has to be done
at that radius, whereas in the latter the matching can be
done at any other radius with σ and p having some other
equation of state.
The sixth junction condition of Eq. (29),
fRRn
a
[∂aR] + fRRn
a
[∂aR] = 0, allows us to infer
that as both R and R are identically zero for both
the metrics given in Eqs. (68) and (69), then ∂aR = 0
and ∂aR = 0 throughout. Consequently, this junction
condition is also automatically satisfied for these two
metrics.
The full solution for the star thin shell in the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity in the geometrical representation is thus determined, it is given by
Eqs. (68)-(72).
B. Scalar-tensor representation
1. The theory and the configuration
Let us start by choosing a theory. Here, we want
the theory in the scalar-tensor representation that corresponds to the theory in the geometrical representation
given above. So, using the same choice of the function
f given by Eq.(67), the scalar fields ψ and ϕ can be
written as functions of R and R as ψ = −

1 + R
R0

,
ϕ = 1 + R
R0
, or inverting, R = −R0 (ψ + 1) and R =
R0 (ϕ − 1), respectively. This invertibility allows us to
find the form of the potential V (ϕ, ψ) associated with
the specific choice of the function f, using the equation
V (ϕ, ψ) = −f (α, β)+ϕα−ψβ derived above, from which
we obtain that the scalar-tensor representation of the theory we want to study is given by the potential
V (ϕ, ψ) = V0 (ψ + 1) (ϕ − 1), (73)
where V0 = −3R0 is a constant.
The configuration for which we want to find a solution
in the scalar-tensor representation is again a star shell
solution. In this way, the correspondence between the
geometrical and the scalar-tensor representations stands
out clearly. Thus, the spacetime is composed of an interior which is Minkowski, a thin shell, and an exterior
which is Schwarzschild.
2. The interior and the exterior solutions
Inserting the metrics for the Minkowski and
Schwarzschild spacetimes and the potential in Eq. (73),
into the modified field equations for the scalar-tensor representation from Eq. (6), yields a partial differential equation for the fields ϕ and ψ. This equation, along with the
two scalar field equations given by Eqs. (8) and (7), is a
set of three equations for the two scalar fields ψ and ϕ.
The solution for these equations is ϕ = 1 and ψ = −1,
constants. The same result can be obtained directly from
the equations ϕ = 1+ R
R0
and ψ = −

1 + R
R0

by setting
R = 0 and R = 0.
Thus the interior line element in spherical coordinates
(t, r, θ, φ), and the interior scalar fields are given by
ds2
i = −dt2 + dr2 + r
2dΩ
2
,
ϕi = 1, ψi = −1 , 0 ≤ r ≤ rΣ , (74)
where the subscript i denotes interior, with dΩ
2 = dθ2 +
sin2
θdφ2 being the line element over the unit sphere,
rΣ being the boundary radius between the interior and
the exterior, and we have not put a subscript i in the
coordinates to not overcrowd the notation.
Likewise, the exterior line element, and the exterior
scalar fields are given by

ϕe = 1, ψe = −1 , rΣ ≤ r < ∞, (75)
where the subscript e denotes exterior, M is the
Schwarzschild mass, and α is a dimensionless constant
that guarantees that the interior and exterior time coordinates are the same, and we have not put a subscript e
in the coordinates to not overcrowd the notation.
3. The matching with a thin shell and the full solution
Let us now apply the junction conditions given in
Eq. (53), see also Eqs. (65) and (66), to perform a matching between these two spacetimes.
The first junction condition in Eq. (53), [hαβ] = 0, sets
the expression for the constant α as α =

1 −
2M
rΣ
−1
,
where rΣ is the radius at which we perform the matching.
The second junction condition of Eq. (53), [K] = 0,
has to be worked carefully. Using the metrics in Eqs. (68
13
and (69), one verifies that for a matching performed at
radius rΣ we have

. The trace of the extrinsic curvature
on a spherical thin shell is K = Kα

and since Kθ
θ = K

, can be put as K = K0
0 + 2Kθ
θ
.
So, taking the trace, we obtain [K] = −
2
r −
3M−2r
r
2
√
1− 2M
r
and thus this junction condition becomes effectively a
constraint on the radius rΣ at which the matching must
be performed, namely, −
2
r −
3M−2r
r
2
√
1− 2M
r
= 0. Solving this
constraint for rΣ yields
rΣ =
9
4
M. (76)
Thus α above has the value α = 9. Again, in the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity we are forced to
perform the matching at a specific value of r to satisfy
the extra [K] = 0 junction condition, whereas in general
relativity this does not happen. Again, the radius 9
4M
in Eq. (76) corresponds to the Buchdahl limit for compactness of a fluid star in general relativity and in the
context of thin shells in general relativity this radius was
first found in [5].
The third junction condition in Eq. (53), [ϕ] = 0, is automatically satisfied since the scalar field ϕ was shown to
be constant in both the interior and the exterior solution,
from which we obtain ϕΣ = 1.
The fourth junction condition in Eq. (53), [ψ] = 0,
is automatically satisfied, since the scalar field ψ was
shown to be constant in both the interior and the exterior
solution, from which we obtain ψΣ = 1.
The fifth junction condition in Eq. (53) is δβ

α. Following now the analysis
from Sec. IV B 1, the energy density σ and the pressure
p of the thin-shell are given by Eqs. (65) and (66). Since
the scalar fields are constant through the two spacetimes,
the junction conditions [ψ] = 0, [ϕ] = 0, [∂cψ] = 0,
and [∂cϕ] = 0 are automatically verified. Also, since the
metrics are the same, then the condition [K] = 0 also
yields the constraint r = rΣ =

K0

. (78)
This is in agreement with Eqs. (71) and (72), as expected.
All the energy conditions, namely, NEC, WEC, DEC,
and SEC are satisfied at the shell.
The sixth junction condition in Eq. (53), [∂aψ] = 0,
is also automatically satisfied since the scalar field ψ is
a constant and thus ∂aψ = 0 for both the interior and
exterior solutions.
The full solution for the star thin shell in the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity in the scalar tensor representation is thus determined, it is given by
Eqs. (74)-(77). It has been made evident that both representations, geometrical and scalar-tensor, give the same
results. This full correspondence between the representations is expected to hold in principle always, or at least
in those cases that there are no unexpected singularities
in one or more fields of one of the representations.
VI. SECOND APPLICATION: A QUASISTAR

AND THIN SHELL: MATCHING TWO
SCHWARZSCHILD SPACETIMES USING A
PERFECT FLUID THICK SHELL
A. Geometrical representation
The first step is to choose a theory, i.e., a form for the
function f (R, R). In this case, we chose
f (R, R) = R g 
R
R

+ R h

R


, (79)
for some well-behaved functions g and h.
The solution we are looking for is a sphericallysymmetric quasistar, i.e., a central Schwarzschild blackhole surrounded by a thick-shell of matter, which in turn
is surrounded by an exterior vacuum spacetime. In this
second application, one can show that the interior junction between the spacetimes just described have a thinshell, whereas the exterior junction is a smooth one.
We have seen that the geometrical and the scalar representations of the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini theory give the same solution. So we will not do the matching in the geometrical representation and pass directly to
the scalar tensor representation.
B. Scalar-tensor representation
1. The theory and the configuration
Let us start by choosing a theory. Here, we want
the theory in the scalar-tensor representation that corresponds to the the theory in the geometrical representation given above in Eq. (79). The potential V equivalent
to Eq. (79) is using V (ϕ, ψ) = −f (α, β) + ϕα − ψβ derived above, given by
V (ϕ, ψ) = 0 . (80)
Thus, the scalars ϕ ans ψ are massless and do not interact
between themselves.
The configuration for which we want to find a solution
is a quasistar, i.e., a central Schwarzschild black hole
14
surrounded by matter in a thick shell, surrounded by
vacuum, in a static spherically symmetric configuration.
It is our second application of the use of the junction
conditions for the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity theory
derived above to match two different spacetimes with a
thin shell and a smooth matching. So, the spacetime that
we study here consists of an interior Schwarzschild black
hole spacetime, in the middle, a shell of perfect fluid with
finite thickness, and an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime.
Let us then assume a general form of a static spherically symmetric form for the metric, a symmetry also
inherited by the scalar fields ϕ and ψ. So we write the
line element as
ds2 = −e

, (81)
where
ζ = ζ(r), (82)
is the redshift function, and
m = m(r). (83)
is the mass function. We write the scalar fields as
ϕ = ϕ(r). (84)
ψ = ψ(r), (85)
We further assume that the distribution of matter can
be described by an anisotropic fluid with stress-energy
tensor of the form T
b
a = diag (−ρ, pr, pt, pt), for some
spacetime region in a range of the radial coordinate r,
such that
ρ = ρ (r) , (86)
pr = pr (r) , pt = pt (r) , (87)
are the energy density, the radial pressure, and the transverse pressure, respectively, with all being functions of
the radial coordinate r.
Inserting Eqs. (81)-(84) and the ansatz for Tab,
Eqs. (86)-(87), into Eqs. (6)-(7) yields a set of five independent equations which read, after rearrangements,

where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to r. We
now have a set of five independent equations for seven
independent variables, namely, ζ, m, ϕ, ψ, ρ, pr, and
pt, with all being functions of the radius r. This means
that we have to impose two independent constraints to
determine the system.
The system we are interested in solving is static and
spherically symmetric and composed of three regions.
The interior region made of a vacuum Schwarzschild
black hole of mass parameter m and horizon radius rh up
to the inner radius rΣi of a thick shell, i.e., a region valid
for rh ≤ r ≤ rΣi
. The middle region made of a thick shell
with matter, from the inner radius rΣi up to its exterior
radius rΣe
, i.e., a region valid for rΣi ≤ r ≤ rΣe
. The
exterior region made of a vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime of mass parameter M, exterior to the thick shell up
to infinity, i.e., a region valid for rΣe ≤ r ≤ ∞. In brief,
the system is a black hole surrounded by a finite nonaccreting matter thick shell, surrounded by vacuum, it is a
quasistar.
2. The interior, the middle, and the exterior solutions
The interior solution: Schwarzschild black hole and constant
scalar fields
For the interior region we assume a vacuum solution valid
up to an interior radius rΣi
, or rΣi
. The ans¨atze and
the equations given in Eqs. (81)-(91) yield a consistent
solution, namely, a black hole solution. Since we are
interested in the exterior to the black hole, i.e., exterior
to the horizon radius rh, the solution is of interest in the
region rh < r ≤ rΣi
.
The interior line element is

where m is the mass in this region, α is a quantity that
will be determined later, and we have not put an index i

on the coordinates to not overcrowd the formulas. Thus,
the metric potentials are
ζi = ln 
1 −


+ ln α , rh < r ≤ rΣi
, (94)
and
mi = m , rh < r ≤ rΣi
, (95)
with m here a constant, the constant mass parameter.
The black hole horizon radius is given in terms of the
mass by rh = 2m. To complete the solution for the fields
we have for the scalar fields
ϕi = ϕi0
, rh < r ≤ rΣi
, (96)
ψi = ψi0
, rh < r ≤ rΣi
. (97)
Since the interior is a vacuum solution, we have Tab =
0, and this can be translated to an energy density and a
pressure as
ρi = 0 , rh < r ≤ rΣi
, (98)
pri = 0 , pti = 0 , rh < r ≤ rΣi
. (99)
The interior solution is thus characterized by a
Schwarzschild black hole, constant scalar fields, and zero
matter fields, i.e., vacuum.
The middle solution: Thick shell
For the middle region we assume a thick shell solution
with matter valid from the interior radius rΣi up to the
exterior radius rΣe
. The ans¨atze and the equations given
in Eqs. (81)-(91) yield a consistent solution, namely,
a physical thick shell. This thick shell solution thus
matches the vacuum Schwarzschild interior, at rΣi
, to an
exterior solution which we assume vacuum Schwarzschild
solution at rΣe
. The range of the coordinate r for the
thick shell region is then rΣi ≤ r ≤ rΣe
. We first present
the solution for the thick shell and then show the rationale employed to obtain it. The constraint we impose is
that the energy density solution is constant, inspired by
the general relativistic Schwarzschild solution with matter. The other constraint that we impose is an appropriate guess for the mass function. The solution for this
middle region is now presented.

where ϕ1 and ϕ2 are constants of integration, and
ψ(r) = ψ0 , rΣi ≤ r ≤ rΣe
, (104)
where ψ0 is a constant of integration.
The solutions for the matter sector, namely, ρ(r),
pr(r), and pt(r) are,
ρ = ρ0 , rΣi ≤ r ≤ rΣe
, (105)
pr = pr(r), pt = pt(r), rΣi ≤ r ≤ rΣe
, (106)
where ρ0 is a constant, the constraint providing the constant density solution, ϕ1 and ϕ2 are the previous mentioned constants of integration, ψ0 is also an imposed
constant, and pr(r) and pt(r) are long expressions, so we
do not write them explicitly here. Instead, we put them
in the Appendix C.
The thick shell solution, i.e., the solution for the middle
region, is visualized in the Appendix C, where all the
fields are plotted.
The rationale to find the solutions just given is the
following. We have a set of five independent equations
for seven independent variables, namely, ζ, m, ϕ, ψ, ρ,
pr, and pt, all functions r. To solve this system we
have to impose two independent constraints. We assume a Schwarzschild type interior solution within the
thick shell, i.e., we want to find solutions with constant
density ρ0, ρ = ρ0, which is Eq. (105). This sets the
right-hand side of Eq. (105). Then we still have 
16
of five independent equations for six independent variables, namely, ζ, m, ϕ, ψ, pr, and pt. This means that
we still can impose one further constraints to determine
the system. The second constraint we choose to impose
is on the function m(r) of the form m (r) = M r
rΣe
,
which is Eq. (102), where M is a constant with units
of mass that will correspond to the Schwarzschild spacetime mass of the exterior solution, and rΣe
is the radius of the outer surface of the thick shell to be matched
to the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. We could have
given, more generically, a mass function of the form
m (r) = M

r
rΣe
n
, with n an exponent. The choice
n = 1 allows one to find analytical solutions. Another
interesting solution could be analyzed by setting n = 3
and then solving the equations numerically. In any case
for n > 0 it can be seen that for r = 0 we obtain m = 0,
i.e., there is no mass at zero radius, so there is no singularity associated to it, and also that at rΣe
one has
m (r = rΣe
) = M, which is in agreement with the value
for the mass of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. At
this point, notice that Eq. (104) features a very simple
solution given by ψ(r) = ψ0, where ψ0 is a constant.
This is just a particular solution for this equation, but
we shall consider it to maintain the simplicity of the full
solution. Now, an equation for ζ
00 that can be derived
from the system of equations given in Eqs. (81)-(91) is

is obtained by subtracting Eq. (8) from Eq. (7), using
Eqs. (88) to (90) to cancel the terms depending on ρ, pr
and pt, and assuming ϕ 6= ψ. Inserting now Eqs. (102)

insert Eqs. (101), (102), and (104), into Eq. (88), and
search for solutions for ϕ that guarantee that the left
hand side of it, and consequently ρ, is constant. The solution for ϕ is ϕ (r) = 4πr2

which is Eq. (103) after rearrangements. Inserting the solutions for m, ζ, ϕ and ψ into Eqs. (89) and (90) yields
the results for both pr and pt, pr = pr(r), pt = pt(r),
which are in Eq. (106), and are long expressions, so we
do not write them explicitly here. Instead, we put them
in Appendix C.
The exterior solution: Schwarzschild spacetime and constant
scalar fields
For the exterior region we assume a vacuum solution valid
from an exterior radius rΣe up to infinity. Again, the
ans¨atze and the equations given in Eqs. (81)-(91) yield
a consistent solution, namely, an exterior Schwarzschild
solution.

, rΣe ≤ r < ∞, (108)
and
me = M , rΣe ≤ r < ∞, (109)
with M here a constant, the constant spacetime mass.
The gravitational radius is rg = 2M, and there is no
horizon in the exterior. To complete the solution we have
for the scalar fields
ϕe = ϕe0
, rΣe ≤ r < ∞, (110)
ψi = ψe0
, rΣe ≤ r < ∞, (111)
i.e., they are constants.
Since the exterior is a vacuum solution, we have Tab =
0, and this can be translated to an energy density and a
pressure as
ρe = 0 , rΣe ≤ r < ∞, (112)
pre = 0 , pte = 0 , rΣe ≤ r < ∞. (113)
The exterior solution is thus characterized by a
Schwarzschild spacetime, constant scalar fields, and zero
matter fields, i.e., vacuum. There is no black hole in this
region.
Our solution is now fully characterized and complete in
each region. We now have to do the matching of the thick
shell solution to the interior and the exterior solutions to
have the full solution.
3. The matching of the thick shell solution and the full
solution
Interior matching of a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime to
a thick shell:
We now do the matching between the interior
Schwarzschild black hole spacetime and the thick shell.
The thick shell solution has divergences for small v
17
of the radial coordinate r. Indeed, in the limit r → 0 the
redshift function ζ(r) diverges and both pressures pr(r)
and pt(r) also diverge. In addition, in some regions, not
in the neighborhood of the center, the energy conditions
are violated. Therefore, if we want to have a nonsingular
thick shell with the matter obeying the energy conditions,
we have to perform a matching with some interior solution that we have chosen to be the Schwarzschild black
hole spacetime together with constant fields ϕ and ψ, see
Eqs. (93)-(96). In this case, an almost smooth matching between these two spacetimes is possible, but in fact
there will be a shell that appears due to the scalar fields.
So, since, albeit mild, there is a thin shell, one must use
the six conditions in Eq. (53).
The interior region is that of a black hole of mass m
and horizon radius given by
rh = 2m , (114)
up to rΣi where the thick shell starts. To find a suitable
radius rΣi
to perform the matching, let us consider the
validity of the energy conditions. By assumption the energy density ρ = ρ0 is positive. It is found by inspection
that for the thick shell solution for r & 2.09M, besides
ρ > 0, one has ρ + pr > 0, ρ + pt > 0, ρ > |pr|, ρ > |pt|,
and ρ+pr+2pt > 0, and so all the energy conditions, i.e.,
NEC, WEC, DEC, and SEC, are satisfied in this region.
Also, in this region we note that pr > 0 and pt > 0, so
there are no tensions. We thus perform the matching for
some r = rΣi
such that
2.09M ≤ rΣi < 3M , (115)
where the number in the first inequality is a number approximated to the second decimal place, and the latter
inequality comes from the fact that rΣi
is always less than
rΣe
and the fact that rΣe = 3M, where M is the mass of
the exterior solution, as we will see.
Now, the continuity of the metric hab has to be imposed, see the first equation in Eq. (53). For the continuity of the metric hab, one has to use the metrics in
Eqs. (81) and (93) to conclude that the factor α that appears in the interior metric Eq. (93) must have the value
α = e

Now, the continuity of the trace of the extrinsic curvature K at rΣi has to be imposed, see the second equation in Eq. (53) at the boundary surface, i.e., at the

. So, [K] = 0 implies that the
matching must be performed at a radius rΣi
given by
rΣi = 3m . (116)
One can tune the value of m to select the radius at
which the matching should be performed. See also that
Eq. (116) implies then that the mass function as given
in Eq. (102) is continuous, and to denote the constant
interior mass by m was a good choice.
The field ϕi

throughout the interior region.
The field ψi
is a constant ψ0i

one must have ψ0i = ψ0, where we have used Eq. (104).
In this way the fourth condition in Eq. (53), [ψ] = 0, is
satisfied. So,
ψi = ψ0 , rh ≤ r ≤ rΣi
, (118)
throughout the interior region, and as a matter of fact
throughout the thick shell and the exterior. The value
ψ0 is a free parameter.

So at rΣi

see Eq. (115), σ > 0, σ + p = 0, and σ = |p|, from which
we conclude that the NEC, WEC, and DEC are verified
no matter the value of rΣi
that we choose within this
region. Note that this shell does not contribute to the
mass. This was expected, since we have found that the
mass m is continuous at rΣi
.
From Eq. (118), the junction condition [∂cψ] = 0, see
the sixth condition in Eq. (53), is trivially satisfied.
Exterior smooth matching of the thick shell to a Schwarzschild
spacetime:
We now do the matching between the thick shell and the
exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. In this case, a smooth
matching between these two spacetimes is possible, so
one uses the six conditions in Eq. (60). As we will see,
the matching to be smooth has to be done necessarily at
rΣe = 3M , (121)
i.e., at the exterior photon orbit sphere.
First the continuity of the metric hab at rΣe has to
be imposed, see the first equation in Eq. (60). For the
continuity of the metric hab, note that the quantity that
appears in Eq. (101) as an exponent has the value β = 3
for M
rΣe

an expression necessary to determine the quantity α that
appears in the junction of the interior region with the
inner border of the thick shell, see above. As well, from
Eq. (102) we have
m(r) = r
3
, rΣi ≤ r ≤ rΣe
. (123)
Then, the continuity of the extrinsic curvature Kab
at rΣe has to be imposed, see the second equation
in Eq. (60), at the boundary, i.e., at rΣe
. The extrinsic curvature Kab(r) for the thick shell is K00 =

Kab (rΣe
) = Keab, so that [Kab] = 0, as it should for a
smooth matching. Of course, the solution rΣe = 3M is
the only possible solution, justifying thus Eq. (121).
Now we deal with the scalar field ϕ. The exterior scalar
field ϕ is a constant ϕe0
, see Eq. (110). Within the thick
shell, ϕ is a varying function of r, ϕ(r), see Eq. (103), so
in order that the junction condition [ϕ] = 0 is satisfied,
see the third condition in Eq. (60), we have to impose
that at the exterior boundary rΣe
one has ϕe0 = ϕ (rΣe
).

Now we deal with the scalar field ψ. The exterior scalar
field ψe is a constant ψe = ψe0
, see Eq. (111), and the
thick shell ψ is also constant ψ0, see Eq. (104), so to
satisfy the junction condition [ψ] = 0, see the fourth
condition in Eq. (60), we put
ψe = ψ0 , rΣe ≤ r < ∞. (125)
The other junction condition on ϕ, namely, [∂cϕ] = 0,
see the fifth condition in Eq. (60), follows by differentiating the solution for ϕ on both sides of rΣe
. From the
exterior one has ∂rϕe0 = 0. This implies that from the
interior one must have ∂rϕ (rΣe
) = 0. The scalar field
ϕ (r) within the thick shell depends on two constants of
integration ϕ1 and ϕ2. Taking the derivative of ϕ (r),
using r = rΣe = 3M, and forcing the derivative to vanish
at rΣe
so that the junction condition [∂cϕ] = 0 is obeyed,
one obtains a relationship between ϕ1 and ϕ2 of the form
ϕ2 =

with ϕ1 a free parameter. Any ϕ1 is a good choice. In
particular, the choice ϕ1 = 54πM2ρ0 leads to pt (rΣe

0, which is the value of the tangential pressure at rΣe
we assume for the solution. For this ϕ1 one gets in addition ϕ2 = 40πM2ρ0. Using the values for M

and ϕ2, just obtained, means that the the scal

rΣi ≤ r ≤ rΣe
, as we have put in Eq. (124). Thus, this
ϕ (r) guarantees that the junction condition [∂cϕ] = 0,
see the fourth condition in Eq. (60), is satisfied. Now
we can turn back to the junction condition [ϕ] = 0, see
the third condition in Eq. (60). At the surface, from
Eq. (124), we have ϕ (rΣe
) = ψ0 + 72πM2ρ0, where
Eq. (121) was used. So, to satisfy the junction condition [ϕ] = 0 one has to impose ϕe = ϕe0 = ϕ (rΣe
), i.e.,
ϕe = ψ0 + 72πM2
ρ0 , rΣe ≤ r < ∞. (126)
Note also that from Eq. (124) one finds that at rΣi
one
obtains Eq. (117) justifying it.
From Eq. (125), the junction condition [∂cψ] = 0, see
the sixth condition in Eq. (60), is trivially satisfied.
For the matter fields one has the energy density ρ as
given in Eq. (105), ρ = ρ0. Also, once rΣe = 3M, and
ϕ1, and ϕ2 have been found, the pressures can now be

The final solution has now four free parameters,
namely, m or rΣi

should put ψ0 < ϕ everywhere, to guarantee that the
coupling (ϕ − ψ) in the field equations Eq. (6) is positive.
The full solution:
The full solution represents a quasistar, i.e., a black hole
surrounded by a spherical nonaccretting star thick shell,
surrounded by an exterior vacuum. The full solution is
then characterized by the following expressions and quantities.
For the interior region, rh < r ≤ rΣi
, where rh = 2m,
we have a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime given by
the line element Eq. (93) with the mass parameter m arbitrary, the field ϕi
is a constant, see Eq. (96), which is
then found from the junction conditions, see Eq. (117),
and the field ψ is a constant, see Eq. (97), with ψi then
found from the junction conditions, see Eq. (118). Since
the interior is vacuum there are no matter fields, see
Eqs. (98) and (99).

FIG. 1. The full solution for the quasistar with a black hole. In the left panel it is plotted the metric fields ζ(r) and m(r) in
units of exterior spacetime mass M, and the scalar fields ϕ(r) and ψ(r) in units of M2
ρ0, which is a dimensionless quantity,
as functions of r, more precisely of r
M , and in the right panel it is plotted the matter fields ρ(r), pr(r), pt(r), σ
M , and p
M , in
units of ρ0, as functions of r, more precisely of r
M , for the full solution, i.e., for rh < r < ∞, where rh = 2m. Note that σ and
p reveal the presence of a thin shell, a mild one, at rΣi
, whereas at rΣe
the solution is smooth. The value chosen for rΣi
is
rΣi = 2.09M. Since rh is given by rh =
2
3
rΣi one has rh = 1.39M. The value for rΣe
is mandatorily rΣe = 3M. The values
chosen for the other free parameters are ψ0 = 0, ρ0 = 1, and M = 1, i.e., all is normalized to M. The NEC, WEC, and DEC,
are satisfied for the full solution. See text for further details.
For the inferior border of the thick shell one has r =
rΣi
, where to satisfy all the energy conditions rΣi
is in
the range given by Eq. (115) which can be put in terms
of m using Eq. (116). The line element can be taken
from Eq. (93) evaluated at rΣi
, ϕ has the value given in
Eq. (117), ψ has the value given in Eq. (118), and the
20
is a thin shell with σ and p given in Eqs. (119) and (120),
respectively.
For the middle region, i.e., the thick shell solution,
rΣi ≤ r ≤ rΣe
, the line element is given in Eq. (100)
together with Eqs. (122) and (123). In addition, ϕ is
the function given in Eq. (124), ψ has the value given in
Eq. (104), and the matter functions ρ, and pr and pt, are
given in Eqs. (105), and (127), respectively.
For the superior border of the thick shell, one has r =
rΣe
, and in terms of M is given by Eq. (121). The line
element is given in Eq. (107) evaluated at rΣe
, ϕ has
the value given in Eq. (126), ψ has the value given in
Eq. (125), and there is no thin shell, the matching is
smooth.
For the exterior region, rΣe ≤ r < ∞, we have an
exterior Schwarzschild spacetime given by the line element Eq. (107) with M the spacetime mass, the field ϕ
is a constant given in Eq. (126), the field ψ is a constant
given in Eq. (125), and since it is vacuum there are no
matter fields, see Eqs. (112) and (113).
The full solution is then given by all the equations cited
above. The full solution is shown in Fig. 1, where plots
of ζ(r), m(r), ϕ(r), ψ(r), ρ(r), pr(r), pt(r), σ(rΣi
), and
p(rΣi
), are given as function of the radius r. The radius
r = rΣi
can be in the range 2.09M ≤ rΣi < 3M, where
3M = rΣe
. For the plots we have chosen the free parameter rΣi
as rΣi = 2.09M. The other free parameters
left are chosen as ψ0 = 0, ρ0 = 1, and the rest is in
terms of M, i.e., M = 1. All other cases for rΣi different
from 2.09M are similar. The only particular case worth
of note is when rΣi = rΣe = 3M, in which case the thick
and thin shells disappear, there is no thick and no thin
shell, and the solution is a Schwarzschild vacuum black
hole with M = m.
VII. THIRD APPLICATION: A WORMHOLE.
THIN SHELL: MATCHING A MATTER
INTERIOR TO A SCHWARZSCHILD-ADS
EXTERIOR
A third application for the use of junction conditions in
the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini matter theory is to
a wormhole solution. In the generalized hybrid metricPalatini matter theory, as in theories of gravitation in
which the gravitational sector is enlarged, there is the
possibility that the energy conditions, in particular the
NEC, for the matter sector are obeyed. In this manner,
the wormhole is not exotic and the flaring out geometry necessary in every wormhole solution is supported by
the higher-order curvature terms in the geometrical representation, or by the two fundamental scalar fields in
the scalar-tensor representation. These terms can then
be interpreted as a gravitational fluid, and in building
such a wormhole one gets exoticity in the gravitational
sector from a trade with exoticity in the matter sector.
We display here a wormhole solution using the scalartensor representation of the theory, knowing that in the
geometrical representation we obtain the same expressions and quantities for the solution. The wormhole
solution we want to work out is composed of three regions. The first region is the inside region containing
matter, where the wormhole throat is situated. It has
two branches that develop out from the throat as is usual
in a wormhole solution. The second region, the middle
region, is composed of a thin shell made of matter, actually, two similar shells, that join each interior branch to
each exterior part. The third region, the exterior region,
is a vacuum Schwarzschild-AdS region that extends up
to infinity. This wormhole solution has the important
feature that the NEC for the matter is verified for the
entire spacetime. Its existence reinforces the believe that
additional fundamental gravitational fields, such as the
scalar fields used here, are behind the construction of
wormholes that do not need exotic matter. Nonetheless,
the engineering of these wormholes is hard to realize, even
theoretically, and so these solutions are probably scant.
This wormhole solution has been presented before [37].
Here we refer briefly to the solution. We use consistently
the nomenclature that we have been using for the metric
fields, the scalar fields, and matter fields. The scalar tensor theory that we employ is one in which the potential
for the scalar fields ϕ(r) and ψ(r) is V (ϕ, ψ) of the form
V (ϕ, ψ) = V0 (ϕ − ψ)
2
, where V0 is some free constant
potential.
Let us start to present the interior region, r0 ≤ r ≤ rΣ.
This interior starts at the wormhole throat with radius r0 and is composed of two symmetric branches,
each branch is in the range r0 ≤ r ≤ rΣ and continues in a symmetric manner up to rΣ where the two
branches are then connected to two independent exterior
regions. The metric function ζ(r) is given by ζ(r) = ζ0,
where ζ0 is a free constant, and the other metric function m(r) is given by m(r) = r

where we have defined for convenience a standard density

4π(−V0)M6 . Let us now present the solution
at the thin shell, i.e., at r = rΣ. There are two thin
shells actually, each one at an rΣ that joins each exterior branch of the wormhole solution. At rΣ the metric
function ζ(r) has the value ζ(rΣ) = ζ0, the metric function m(r) suffers a jump due to the fact that the shell
has some energy-density, actually negative so that the
mass decreases, the field ϕ(r) is continuous and thus it
has the value ϕ(rΣ) = ψ0 −

σ + p > 0. One has to be careful in choosing rΣ since it
has to be greater than the gravitational radius of the solution, otherwise there would be a horizon and the solution
would be invalid. For this one has to bear in mind that
the gravitational radius rg of an exterior ShwarzschildAdS spacetime always obeys rg < 2M. Let us continue
with the exterior region, rΣ ≤ r < ∞. The exterior region is composed of two symmetric parts each joining the
interior region at arΣ. The metric function ζ(r) in the
exterior is given by e

and so is a constant, and the scalar field ψe(r) is given by
ψe(r) = ψ0, also a constant. Thus, Λ = −

. Then, Λ
is negative and the exterior spacetime is SchwarzschildAdS. The matter fields in the exterior region are given
by ρ = 0, pr = 0, and pt = 0.
To have a definite solution we choose r0 = 2
q
10
11M,
rΣ = 2M, ζ0 = −10.96, ψ0 = 1, and V0 = −42.
The choice for a negative V0 is that it makes the quantity σ + p positive and so the NEC is satisfied. Indeed, σ = −0.0605ρ0M and p = 0.0632ρ0M, so that
σ + p = 0.0027ρ0M, is positive, and the matter in the
shell obeys the NEC. Λ is negative, it is Λ = −0.03788,
thus the exterior is a Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime. We
normalize all quantities to the spacetime mass M, which
amounts to put M = 1. The matter WEC does not hold
on the shell but holds everywhere else. The matter NEC,
which is the most important energy condition, is obeyed
everywhere in conformity with our aim. This completes
our full wormhole solution. Figure 2 displays the solution. For a full account of this wormhole solution see

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
The generalization from the general relativity action
containing the Ricci scalar R alone plus matter to generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity action containing
in the geometric representation a function of the Ricci
scalars R and R, and in the scalar-tensor representation
a function of the Ricci scalar R and two scalar fields ψ
and φ, in which one can add matter fields to both, leads
to new junction conditions in both representations. We
have presented the junction conditions for the generalized
hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, for both the geometrical
and the scalar-tensor representation of the theory, in the
cases of a thin shell junction and of a smooth matching.
In the geometrical representation of the generalized hy
22
brid metric-Palatini gravity, in the case of a matching
with a thin shell, the conformal relation between R and
R, implies that the jump of the derivatives of R and R do
not contribute independently to the stress energy tensor
of the shell. In fact, the two quantities must have a specific relation. It also follows that the normal derivative
of the Ricci scalar being not continuous, gives rise to the
existence of the matter thin shell. In the case of a smooth
matching, we obtained that the trace of the extrinsic curvature and the Ricci scalar must be continuous, and also
that the normal derivative of the Ricci scalar must be
continuous. Moreover, given the conformal relation between R and R, it follows that the continuity of R implies
the continuity of R.
In the scalar-tensor representation of the generalized
hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, some interesting results
also appeared which can be compared with the junction
conditions for the Brans-Dicke theory. In the case of a
matching with a thin shell, the trace of the extrinsic curvature must be continuous, on one hand emphasizing the
relation between the geometrical and the scalar-tensor
representation of the theory, on the other hand showing
its difference to the Brans-Dicke theory where the trace
of the extrinsic curvature does not need to be continuous. Moreover, since only the scalar field ϕ is coupled to
matter, only the derivative of ϕ is allowed to be discontinuous in which case it contributes to the stress energy of
the thin shell. In the case of a smooth matching, it turns
out that the scalar fields and their normal derivatives
must be continuous. As well, the trace of the extrinsic
curvature must be continuous.
The importance and usefulness of these junction conditions is explicit, as it helped to find three different solutions, one for a spacetime with a thin shell as a simplified
model of a star, other for a three-region spacetime with
a thick shell as a simplified model of a quasistar, and yet
another for a wormhole.
The use of the junction conditions allowed us to satisfy
all the energy conditions for the star thin shell and the
quasistar thick shell solutions, and to satisfy the matter
NEC for the wormhole spacetime solution which generically is something very hard to achieve. These results
point towards the physical relevance of the solutions obtained. Of course, to progress further with the physical
meaningfulness of the solutions found, one has to perform a stability study to radial perturbations to start
with, and then a full stability analysis.
It should be mentioned that, although the equivalence
between the two representations, geometrical and scalartensor, can be unambiguous in some results, such as the
continuity of the trace of the extrinsic curvature or the
direct implication between the continuity of the scalar
fields to the continuity of R and R, the equivalence of
the remaining results is not so clear cut. For instance, in
the second application of a quasistar which has a thick
shell, although not obvious and not made explicitly, one
can show that the transformation fR = ϕ yields the same
expression in both representations, geometric and scalartensor, in what concerns the density and transverse pressure of the inner thin shell. Moreover, the relation between the derivatives of R and R in the geometrical representation can also be found in the scalar tensor representation since a replacement fR = ψ leads to the correct
relation. We may then conclude that the junction conditions in both representations are indeed equivalent.
It has been also made clear that matched solutions in
the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity have more
restrictions than matched solutions in general relativity.
This means that matched solutions in general relativity
may not necessarily be solutions in the generalized hybrid
metric-Palatini gravity, a simple example of this fact is
for self-gravitating thin shells of matter that in the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity are constrained to
have a specific radius rΣ =
9M
4
, whereas in general relativity the shells can have any radius rΣ as long as rΣ is
greater than the gravitational radius.
The restriction on the matching radius arises from the
extra junction condition [K] = 0, which does not exist in
general relativity. This extra junction condition is common in metric theories of gravity where the Lagrangian
has an arbitrary dependence on the metric Ricci scalar
R, from which f (R) and f (R, T) are other known examples. To avoid the [K] = 0 junction condition, one must
recur to metric-affine theories of gravity, a well-known
example being the case of the pure Palatini f (R) theory, and another possible example being the case of the
Palatini f (R, T) gravity theory.

Appendix A: Explicit equation of Sec. II
We have derived the field equations of the generalized
hybrid metric-Palatini gravity in the geometrical representation in terms of derivatives of the function f (R, R)
in Sec. II. As shown in Eq. (4), these derivatives can be
expanded in terms of derivatives of R and R. Since the
complete expanded field equation is big, we opted to not
write it there, we do it here. For that, we insert the set
of equations given in Eq. (4) into the field equation given
in Eq. (2), and obtain the fully extended field equation
in the form

Appendix B: A more general theory for the star
shell application of Sec. V
In Sec. V, in the first application of the junction conditions formalism in generalized hybrid metricPalatini gravity, on a star thin shell matching an interior Minkowski spacetime to an exterior Schwarzschild
spacetime, we have chosen a specific theory for f (R, R),
namely, f (R, R) = R + R +
RR
R0
. Here we give a more
general f (R, R) and find the matter properties for the
thin shell in the geometrical representation.
We consider the following form of the function
f (R, R),
f (R, R) = g (R) + Rh

R

(B1)
where g (R) and h

are well behaved functions of

For this specific choice of the function f, we can write

Notice that the specific choice of the function f in
Eq. (B1) allows us to write Rab as a function of Rab
and R only, implying that we can use Eq. (B4) and its
trace, and use Eqs. (B1) and (B2) to cancel the terms
depending on Rab and R in the field equation given in
Eq. (2) and obtain an equation that only depends on the
metric gab and its derivatives. The simplification presented in Eq. (B4) is not possible in general. Indeed, for
a generic choice of the function f for which fR depends
on R, Eq. (3) becomes a partial differential equation for
R and the problem is much more complicated.
Considering a Minkowski spacetime inside and a
Schwarzschild spacetime outside, we can find the matter properties of the shell at rΣ for the theory given in
Eq. (B1). All we have worked out in Sec. V for the
geometrical representation follows apart the the sixth
junction condition of Eq. (29). The two components of
Eq. (29) correspond to S

0 = −σ and S

θ = p. Since, the
the second junction condition in Eq. (29) is [K] = 0, for
a spherically symmetric thin shell one can write

is given by the two independent components, namely,

results one has to specify form for f (R, R). It is at this
