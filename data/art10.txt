Abstract—In this paper, we explore a dual-functional radarcommunication (DFRC) system for achieving integrated sensing
and communications (ISAC). The technique of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is leveraged to overcome
the frequency-selective fading of the wideband multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one multi-antenna DFRC
base station (BS) and multiple single-antenna user equipment
(UEs). In order to restrain the high peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) of OFDM signals, we aim to jointly design low-PAPR
DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveforms. This is done by utilizing a
weighted objective function on both communication and radar
performance metrics under power and PAPR constraints. The
formulated optimization problems can be equivalently transformed into standard semi-definite programming (SDP) and can
be effectively solved by semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method,
where we prove that globally optimal rank-1 solution can be
obtained in general. We further develop a low-complexity method
to solve the problems with much reduced overheads. Moreover,
the practical scenario with oversampling on OFDM signals
is further considered, which has a significant effect on the
resulting PAPR levels. The feasibility, effectiveness, and flexibility
of the proposed low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform
design methods are demonstrated by a range of simulations on
communication sum rate, symbol error rate as well as radar
beampattern and detection probability.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Motivations and Prior Works
The explosive growth of mobile and Internet-of-things (IoT)
devices along with the severe spectrum shortage have driven
the demand for an ever-increasing spectrum usage efficiency.
To meet the impending need of massive connectivity in 2025
with around 75 billion devices worldwide [1], sharing/resuing
spectrum resources that have already been assigned to other
existing applications is regarded as a promising strategy for
future communication networks. Among the available applications, radar spectrum is widely regarded as a promising
candidate that can facilitate communication and radar spectrum sharing (CRSS) due to the fact that the radar spectrum

provides large frequency bands that are suitable for wireless
communications, and thus a win-win spectrum sharing policy
can be achieved for both sides [2]. As a step further, with
sharing one set of hardware equipment and signal processing
frameworks for communications and radar, dual-functional
radar-communication (DFRC) design provides a cost-efficient
way for achieving integrated sensing and communications
(ISAC) [3, 4]. In fact, the techniques of DFRC and ISAC are
eagerly required by future intelligent 6G and IoT applications,
such as smart cities, smart homes, automatic driving, industry
4.0, etc., which have drawn great attention from both academia
and industry recently [3–6].
DFRC systems aim at fulfilling wireless communications
and radar detections simultaneously through designing a single
transmitted waveform. For radar-centric DFRC systems [3, 7–
9], standard radar waveforms are employed and information is
introduced by modulating and signaling for communications.
In comparison, for communication-centric DFRC systems [4,
10–12], the communication waveforms are directly exploited
for sensing by extracting the radar information from targets
echoes. It is known that radar-centric DFRC systems are
capable of providing desirable sensing performance but with
limited communication rates below 5G requirements, while
communication-centric systems can achieve favorable communication performance but with unreliable and difficult-to-tune
sensing performance [5, 6]. Recently, more attention is focused
on DFRC systems with joint DFRC waveform design [13–15]
to guarantee both sensing and communication performance,
which is not limited by any existing radar or communication
waveforms and is promising to achieve scalable performance
trade-off between the two functionalities.
The technique of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as a key enabler for 4G and 5G wireless
networks, is part of communication standards and has been
studied extensively [16–18]. Actually, OFDM has also recently
been exploited for radar sensing [10, 19–22]. The orthogonal property of OFDM waveform fulfilled by the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) and inverse DFT (IDFT) operations
at transceivers can facilitate signal processing for both communications and radar sensing. A pioneer work [10] considered a
communication-centric DFRC multiple-input multiple output
(MIMO) OFDM system which provided a way of introducing
radar sensing into a MIMO-OFDM system. In [19], a radarcentric DFRC MIMO-OFDM system with sidelobe control for
communications was studied where the transmit and receive
beamforming were optimized to maximize the radar metric
of Kullback-Leibler divergence. The total radiated power was
minimized in another radar-centric DFRC work [20] through
subcarrier selection and power allocation with a primary radar
purpose and a secondary communications purpose. Both radarcentric and joint design scenarios were addressed in recent
work [21] where the DFRC trade-off waveform was optimized by taking the feedback overhead for conveying transmit
waveform control information into consideration. A wideband
DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform was jointly designed in [22],
where precoding and antenna selection matrices were optimized to meet a joint communication-sensing performance.
Even though OFDM waveform is an excellent candidate
for joint design of DFRC systems, one major disadvantage of
OFDM waveform is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
which should be effectively dealt with. Otherwise, high PAPR
may cause non-linear distortion of the transmit signals and lead
to radar/communication performance degradation considering
the limited linear region of the low-cost power amplifiers [23–
25]. In [19], the PAPR constraints were considered in a radarcentric DFRC system to restrain the PAPR of MIMO-OFDM
waveform. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the
DFRC OFDM systems in the state-of-the-art literature have not
taken the PAPR constraints into consideration, especially for
the joint design DFRC systems. Moreover, PAPR is originally
defined on the continuous-time passband signals [18], and thus
oversampling may be necessary for obtaining accurate PAPR
levels based on the discrete-time MIMO-OFDM waveform. It
is verified that the discrete-time OFDM signal can get almost
the same PAPR as the continuous-time signal if it is Υ-times
interpolated (oversampled) with Υ ≥ 4 [18, 23].
B. Our Contributions
In this paper, we consider a wideband DFRC multi-user
MIMO (MU-MIMO) OFDM system, where a multi-antenna
DFRC base station (BS) acts as a cellular BS and a MIMO
radar to generate DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveforms used for
downlink data transmission and far-field targets detection
simultaneously. We design low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM
waveforms so as to achieve a tunable performance trade-off
between wireless communications and radar sensing.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We jointly design the DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveforms
by optimizing a weighted objective function on both
communications and radar performance metrics under transmit power and PAPR constraints. The PAPR
constraints are introduced to restrain the modulus of the
DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveforms so as to avoid signal
distortion caused by hardware limitation, e.g., low-cost
non-linear power amplifiers, leading to energy-efficient
data transmissions and target detections.
• We first address low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform design in the scenario with Nyquist-rate sampling.
The PAPR of discrete-time DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform with Nyquist-rate sampling is derived and used for
PAPR constraints. The formulated problem is transformed
into a standard semi-definite programming (SDP) and can
be optimally solved by the semi-definite relaxation (SDR)
method, where we can prove that the rank-1 solution
exists in general.
• A low-complexity method is further proposed to divide
the original problem into sub-problems and obtain an
effective solution with much reduced complexity. All
the subproblems can be solved parallelly with much
less optimization variables, and thus the computational
complexity can be significantly reduced.
• We further consider the practical case of DFRC MIMOOFDM waveform with an oversampling rate Υ ≥ 4,
and design a new low-PAPR approach. Oversampling
is required in practical OFDM systems with low-cost
non-linear power amplifiers, where the PAPR level of
ODFM waveform can be measured in a more accurate
way. We derive the PAPR expression and transform
the optimization problem for low-PAPR DFRC MIMOOFDM waveform design into a standard SDP though
elaborate transformations. The global optimal solution
can also be achieved by the SDR method which is shown
to offer rank-1 solution in general. We further advance
this approach with a low-complexity method to obtain an
effective solution.
The simulation results verify that the PAPR levels of our designed DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform can be reduced from
12.5dB/10.5dB to 3dB in the case of radar/communication
priority with very slight performance degradation. Satisfactory
performance tradeoff between the communications and radar
can be achieved through effectively tuning the weighting factor
on these two functionalities, demonstrating the feasibility,
effectiveness, and flexibility of the proposed methods for lowPAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform design.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the considered system models including the DFRC
waveform, the communication, and the radar models. The
problem formulation as well as the low-PAPR DFRC MIMOOFDM waveform design with Nyquist-rate sampling are given
in Section III. In Section IV, the practical scenario with
oversampling is considered where the optimization problem
is solved based on a more accurate PAPR measurement. The
simulation results are provided in Section V, and we conclude
our paper in Section VI.

aiming at serving K downlink single-antenna user equipment
(UEs) and sensing M far-field targets simultaneously.
In the considered wideband DFRC MIMO-OFDM system
with sufficient bandwidth, high distance resolution can be
achieved for radar detection. However, the communication
channels with multiple taps undergo significant frequencyselective fading due to the fact that the bandwidth is much
larger than the channel coherence bandwidth [17]. It is well
known that OFDM is an effective technique for overcoming
frequency-selective fading while fully exploiting the frequency
diversity, which is widely used in practical communication
systems. Through the OFDM technique, each wideband channel can be divided into multiple orthogonal frequency-flat
subchannels [18]. On the other hand, the OFDM technique
introduces the disadvantage of enlarging the PAPR of the
transmitted signal waveform, which may lead to crucial signal
distortion. Hence, the transmitted signal waveform should be
carefully designed so as to effectively restrain the corresponding PAPR of the OFDM signals.
In this paper, the proposed system is denoted as DFRC
MIMO-OFDM system, and the transmitted signal waveform
is named as DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform. Our objective
is to effectively design the transmitted DFRC MIMO-OFDM
waveform under transmit power and specific PAPR constraints,
so as to obtain desirable low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM
waveform achieving satisfactory performance tradeoff between
communications and radar functionalities.
A. DFRC MIMO-OFDM Waveform Formulation
We assume that the wireless communication channels are
with the memory of U − 1, i.e., each has U effectively nonzero channel taps. In addition, the length of the effective
data symbols in each block is Ns which need modulate
Ns subcarriers for transmissions [17], and we denote the
index of symbols/subcarriers as n ∈ Ns = {1, · · · , Ns}. In
order to eliminate inter-symbol interference (ISI) of wideband
multicarrier transmissions, the standard OFDM technique of
cyclic prefix (CP) is utilized [18]. The length of CP is denoted
as Nc with Nc ≥ U − 1, and thus the total number of timedomain samples per block is N = Ns + Nc. Without lose of
generality, we use Nc = U − 1 in this paper.
1) Symbol Data and Preoding Model: Let
S = [S

T ∈ C
NsK×L (1)
represent the symbol data matrix for all UEs of k ∈ K =
{1, · · · , K} on Ns subcarriers, transmitted during a communication frame with length L.
1 Here, Sn = [sn,1, · · · , sn,K]
T ∈
C
K×L is the symbol matrix for all UEs on subcarrier n ∈ Ns
with sn,k ∈ C
L×1 being the specific symbol vector for user
k. In addition, W = diag(W1, · · · ,WNs
) ∈ C
NsNt×NsK is
the compact precoding matrix for all UEs on all subcarriers
where Wn = [wn,1, · · · , wn,K] ∈ C
Nt×K is the precoding
matrix for all UEs on subcarrier n ∈ Ns with wn,k ∈ C
Nt×1
being the specific precoding vector for user k.
The transmit symbol data S is first precoded by W in the
frequency domain and then converted to the time domain by
IDFT operation before subcarrier modulations. We further use
Xs = WS = [XT

Ns

T ∈ C
NsNt×L
(2)
to indicate the baseband precoded symbol matrix on all
subcarriers before the IDFT processing where Xn = WnSn ∈

being the (n, m)-th element of Fs for n, m ∈ Ns. The IDFT
processing at the transmitter of the DFRC-BS is operated
by (FH

) ∈ C
NsNt×NsNt considering the fact that the
ULA array is equipped with Nt transmit antennas. Hence, the
transmitted time-domain data signal waveform after IDFT can
be further expressed as

T ∈ C

where Gn = (f

for n ∈ Ns. Also, fs,n ∈ C
Ns×1
indicates the n-th column of
the DFT matrix Fs corresponding to the (I)DFT operations on
the n-th subcarrier.
2) DFRC MIMO-OFDM Waveform with CP: The next step
is adding CP with size Nc = U − 1, which is crucial for
eliminating the ISI caused by multi-path frequency-selective
fading. It is operated by repeating the last Nc symbols at the
beginning of the original symbol sequence [26]. We denote
Xc = [XT
Ns−Nc+1, XT
Ns−Nc+2, · · · , XT

]
T ∈ C
NcNt×L, (5)
Fc = [fs,Ns−Nc+1,fs,Ns−Nc+2, · · · ,fs,Ns

and let
X˙ = [XT
c
, XT
s
]
T ∈ C
NNt×L, (7)
F˙ = [Fc, Fs] ∈ C
Ns×N , (8)
then the transmitted DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform after
adding CP can be expressed as

T, (9)
1L is the length of the radar pulse/communication block, corresponding to
the number of OFDM symbols in the time domain.
recalling that N = Nc + Ns. Through operating the IDFT
and adding the CP at the transmitter side, the effects of ISI
caused by frequency-selective fading can be eliminated after
removing the CP and operating the DFT at the receiver side.
B. MIMO-OFDM Communication Model
1) Overall Downlink Channel and Received Signal: After
adding the CP, the signal is then up-converted to the radio
frequency (RF) domain through subcarrier modulations for
transmission via Nt RF chains connected to Nt antennas.
As mentioned before, the wireless channels from the DFRCBS to the downlink UEs are assumed as wideband frequencyselective fading channels with memory of U − 1, which is
assumed time-invariant for a sufficiently long time-scale [17].
Hence, the discrete-time impulse response of the channel from
the DFRC-BS to UE k ∈ K can be denoted as
hek(τ) =
U
X−1
u=0
hek,uδ(τ − u) ∈ C
1×Nt
, ∀k ∈ K, ∀τ (10)
where hek,u ∈ C
1×Nt
is the time-invariant channel vector
of the u-th tap and it is assumed as hek,u ∼ CN (0,
1
U
INt
)
with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading
coefficients for any k ∈ K and u ∈ U = {0, · · · , U − 1}.
Furthermore, we use
He (τ) =
U
X−1
u=0
He uδ(τ − u) ∈ C
K×Nt
, ∀τ (11)
to represent the compact channel matrix from the DFRC-BS to
K downlink UEs, where He u = [heT
1,u, · · · , heT
K,u]
T ∈ C
K×Nt
is the corresponding channel matrix of the u-th tap.
Lemma 1. The overall effective downlink channel matrix
of the DFRC MIMO-OFDM system on the n-th symbol subcarrier can be written in frequency domain as [17, 26]
Hn =

Also, we have Hn = [h

T ∈ C
K×Nt with
hk,n =
PU−1
u=0 hek,ue
−
j2πu(n−1)
Ns ∈ C
1×Nt being the corresponding channel for UE k ∈ K. In addition, the received
signal of symbol data sequence can be expressed as
Ys = HsXs + Zs ∈ C
NsK×L (13)
where Hs = diag(H1, · · · , HNs
) ∈ C
NsK×NsNt and Zs ∈
C
NsK×L is the matrix of the additive white gaussian noise
(AWGN) on Ns subcarriers with i.i.d. random variables following CN (0, σ2
). Specifically, the corresponding noiseless
received signal on the subcarrier n can be expressed as HnXn
for n ∈ Ns [17, 26].
Proof. See Appendix A.
In this paper, we assume that the channels are known to
the DFRC-BS, which can be obtained through conventional
channel estimation methods.
2) Multi-user Interference (MUI) and Sum Rate: The
downlink MU-MIMO OFDM transmissions will induce MUI,
which will have great effects on the performance of the
achievable sum rate as well as the symbol error rate (SER)
of the downlink UEs. Assuming that the data symbols for
all UEs of k ∈ K on all subcarriers of n ∈ Ns follow the
same constellation modulation, we can re-express the compact
received signal in (13) as
Ys = S
|{z}
Signal
+ (HsXs − S)
| {z }
MUI
+ Zs
|{z}
Noise
, (14)
where HsXs −S represents the MUI signals caused by multiuser transmissions [27]. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) of UE k ∈ K on subcarrier n ∈ Ns per frame
can be further expressed as
SINRk,n =
E{|s
l
n,k|
2}
E{|hk,nxl
n − s
l
n,k|
2} + σ
2
, (15)
where s
l
n,k is the l-th element of the symbol vector sn,k and
x
l
n ∈ C
Nt×1
is the l-th column of the precoded symbol
matrix Xn for all UEs. The expectations in (15) are taken
with respect to (w.r.t.) the time index l ∈ L = {1, · · · , L}
[14], and E{|s
l
n,k|
2} is fixed with given constellation mode.
Hence, the maximum achievable sum rate of the K downlink
UEs on subcarrier n can be given as
Rn =
X
K
n=1
log2
(1 + SINRk,n). (16)
The average sum rate/spectral efficiency of the MIMO-OFDM
system is measured as
R =

Note that the MUI is an important performance metric of
the DFRC MIMO-OFDM system which should be minimized
from the perspective of communications, so as to increase the
achievable sum rate and decrease the SER. To this end, in the
following we employ the MUI as our objective/cost function
for enhancing the communication performance of the DFRC
MIMO-OFDM system, given as

C. MIMO-OFDM Radar Model
1) Radar Beampattern: Radar beampattern is a crucial
indicator for measuring the radar detection and tracking performance. Note that MIMO radar is capable of achieving higher
degrees of freedom (DoFs) than traditional phased-array radar
through generating uncorrelated MIMO waveforms [28]. It
has been verified that designing MIMO radar beampattern
can be equivalently transformed into designing the probing
signal waveform as the radar beampattern is highly related to
the covariance matrix of the probing waveform [14, 28–30].
For the considered DFRC MIMO-OFDM system, the transmit
radar beampattern versus the detection angle θ is written as
Bd(θ) = 1

(20)
under the assumption that even number of transmit antennas
are equipped at the DFRC-BS ULA and the center of the ULA
is chosen as the reference point. In addition, RG,n ∈ C
Nt×Nt
is the effective spatial covariance matrix of the transmit DFRC
MIMO-OFDM waveform on the n-th subcarrier for n ∈ Ns
which is defined as
RG,n =

L
GnGH

. (21)
In order to ensure that the covariance matrices {RG,n}n∈Ns
are positive-definite, we assume that the frame length satisfies
L ≥ Nt, which is easy to achieve in the considered wideband
scenario with approximately time-invariant channels.
2) Radar Detection Probability: From the perspective of
radar, another important performance indicator is the detection
probability. To derive the detection probability, we first express
the radar received target echo signal by the DFRC-BS at the
l-th snapshot/frame as
y
r
l = αΥ(θ)g
s
l + z
r ∈ C
NsNt×1
, (22)
which is an expanded radar received echo vector considering
the Ns i.i.d data streams on the Ns subcarriers for l ∈ L.
Here, α is the complex path loss of the radar-target-radar path,

addition, Υ(θ) = INs ⊗ Υe (θ) ∈ C
NsNt×NsNt with Υe (θ) =
ar(θ)a

(θ) ∈ C
Nt×Nt where ar(θ) and at(θ) are the transmit
and receive steering vector with ar(θ) = at(θ) = a(θ).
Next by leveraging the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test

radar detection probability as

To design our DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform, we employ
a desired benchmark of the MIMO-OFDM radar waveform,
denoted as G0 , (FH

waveform before IDFT operation, which is capable to achieve
desirable detection probability. One such benchmark waveform
of G0 can be obtained by leveraging the Directional Beampattern Design. From the viewpoint of radar performance, it is
beneficial to make the DFRC waveform G = (FH

III. LOW-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM WAVEFORM
DESIGN WITH NYQUIST-RATE SAMPLING
In this section, we consider the scenario leveraging the
Nyquist-rate sampling where the sampled sequence corresponds to the symbol sequence [33]. Our aim is to achieve a
desirable performance tradeoff between communications and
radar detections through elaborately designing the precoded
DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform matrix Xs ∈ C

the PAPR as well as the power allocation constraints.2
A. PAPR of the DFRC MIMO-OFDM Waveform
PAPR is defined as the ratio between the maximum power
and the average power of the complex passband signal [18],

Gb  0, (52f)
rank(Gb ) = 1, (52g)
through optimizing the hermitian semi-definite matrix variable
Gb . By dropping the rank-1 constraint on Gb in (52g), problem
(P5) in (52) becomes a standard SDP and can be effectively
solved by the classic SDR technique via the existing numerical
tools, e.g., CVX.
Lemma 2. It can be proved that the rank-1 solution exist in
general for the SDR of problem (P5) in (52), indicating that
the globally optimal solution of problem (P5) can always be
obtained by solving its SDR without considering the rank-1
constraint (52g), denoted as Gb o
.
Proof. See Appendix B.
Once we obtain the optimal solution of Go based on Gb o
,
then the optimal precoded DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform on
the symbol subcarriers can be expressed as Xo
s = D−1
s Go
.
The previously proposed SDR method for solving problem
(P5) in (52) can obtain the global optimal solution of the
original problem (P2) in (37), but its computation complexity
is quite high. We can observe that the number of optimization
variables for problem (P5) is (NsNtL + 1)2 which is nearly
proportional to the square of NsNtL, and thus high computational complexity may hinder its use in practical systems,
especially considering the wideband scenario with longer
coherent frame, i.e., with larger L. Next, we propose a method
with much lower complexity by dividing the original problem
(P2) into L subproblems corresponding to each frame/snapshot
of the DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform.
D. Low-Complexity Approach
In order to solve problem (P2) in (37) with low complexity,
we further transform problem (P2) into the following form

where gl ∈ C

and g0,l ∈ C

correspond to the l-th column of G, S and G0, respectively.
Also, gl,i indicates the i-th element of gl
. In problem (P6), the
original sum power allocation constraints in (37c) and (37d) of
problem (P2) is respectively further relaxed into L individual
power allocation constraints as in (53c) and (53d) for l ∈ L,
which is optimal in the average basis and easy to operate in
practical communication systems. Note that problem (P6) can
be parallelly solved by addressing L sub-problems as shown
in the following l-th sub-problem (P6.1)

which is similar to problem (P5) in (52) where

being the l-th column of B. The SDR of problem (P6.2) in
(55) can also be solved with CVX by dropping the rank-1
constraint (55g), and it can be verified that the rank-1 solution
exist in general via the same method of Lemma 2.
The number of optimization variables for solving problem
(P6.2) in (55) is (NsNt+1)2
, and thus the computational complexity/running time can be significantly reduced comparing
with solving problem (P5) in (52). In the simulation results, we
leverage the low-complexity method of solving sub-problems
proposed in this section due to the fact that it is easy to exceed
the array size of MATLAB operation when solving the original
problem (P5) in (52) with the SDR algorithm given in Section
III-C, especially with larger values of Ns, Nt and L.
E. Desired Benchmark of Radar Waveform with Directional

, where Xd
s,0
is the corresponding
precoded waveform. Assuming Rd ∈ C
Nt×Nt
is a Hermitian
positive semi-definite covariance matrix corresponding to a
well designed MIMO radar beampattern on a single carrier,
the radar detection waveform of the considered MIMO-OFDM
system via the directional beampattern design can be obtained
by solving the following MUI minimization problem
min

Considering the Cholesky decomposition on Rd, we have

where Φ ∈ C
NsNt×NsNt
is a lower triangular matrix. Without
loss of generality, we assume Rd is positive-definite such that
INs ⊗ Rd is positive-definite as well which can guarantee
that Φ is invertible. Hence, the constraint in (59b) can be
equivalently re-expressed as

based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is given as
GΦ = UINsNt×LVH, (63)
where UΣVH = ΦHHH
DS is the SVD of ΦHHH
DS. Hence, the

which can be used as a desired benchmark of radar waveform,
i.e., G0, used in problem (P2) in (37).
IV. LOW-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM WAVEFORM
DESIGN WITH OVERSAMPLING
OFDM introduces large amplitude variations in time, which
may result in significant signal distortion in the presence of
non-linear amplifiers. In practical OFDM systems utilizing
low-cost non-linear amplifiers, the technique of oversampling
is usually required for digital pre-distortion to avoid serious
distortion of the time-domain signals [35]. Meanwhile, we
can obtain a more accurate PAPR measurement through the
oversampled signals compared with the scenario leveraging
Nyquist-rate sampling in Section III (oversampling rate equals
to 1). Based on the results in [18, 23], PAPR levels can be
accurately measured if the discrete-time signals are Υ-times
interpolated (oversampled) with Υ ≥ 4. Hence, in this section, we further address the low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM
waveform design in the practical scenario with oversampling.
A. Problem Formulation
Considering an oversampling rate Υ ≥ 4, the corresponding IDFT of each transmit antenna should with ΥNs input
and output points. We further denote Fos ∈ C
ΥNs×ΥNs
as the normalized oversampling DFT matrix where F
os
i,m =
√
1
Ns
e
−j
2π
ΥNs
(i−1)(m−1) is the (i, m)-th element with index
i, m ∈ Nos = {1, 2, · · · , ΥNs}. In addition, the precoded
symbol matrix should be Υ-times interpolated with 0 as
Xos =

ΥNsNt×L, (65)
considering even number of subcarriers Ns, then the oversampled IDFT output can be written as (FH
os ⊗ INt
)Xos ∈
C
ΥNsNt×L. Hence, the PAPR constraint of the oversampled
discrete-time signal for the DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform
after IDFT can be expressed as
PAPR(Xos) =

ΥNs×Nc being formulated by the last Nc columns

Nc×Nt being formulated by the last
NcNt rows of Xos, similar to the definitions of Fc in (6) and
Xc in (5), respectively. It is easy to observe that Xc
os = Xc in
the practical scenario where Nc ≤ Ns/2, which is considered
in this paper.4
In (66), (a) and (b) are based on the fact that

Hence, the PAPR constraint in (66) is equivalent to the set of

It is easy to note the effective elements of the oversampled
matrix Xos ∈ C
ΥNsNt×L in (65) are exactly the elements
of the original precoded symbol matrix Xs ∈ C
NsNt×L. For
utilizing the accurate PAPR constraint (70) and facilitating the
formulation of the optimization problem for the effective matrix Xs, one challenging lies in transforming (FH
os ⊗ INt
)Xos
in (70) into a function of Xs, which is also a key step for
simplifying the problem solving process and reducing the
computational complexity. To this end, we further denote an
equivalent oversampling DFT matrix Feos ∈ C
ΥNs×Ns as

and it is easy to prove that
(F

ΥNsNt×L. (72)
Then the PAPR constraints in (70) can be equivalently transformed into

Considering the equivalent IDFT operation FeH

ΥNsNt×NsNt and DFT operation Feos ⊗INt ∈ C
NsNt×ΥNsNt
over the MIMO-OFDM system, we further have
(Feos ⊗ INt

os ⊗ INt
) = INsNt ⇔
(FeH
os ⊗ INt
)
† = Feos ⊗ INt = (FeH
os ⊗ INT
)
H, (74)
where (FeH
os ⊗ INt
)
†
represents the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of FeH
os⊗INt
. Hence, we can formulate the optimization
problem similar as problem (P2) in (37) by optimizing the
DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform matrix after IDFT operation,
i.e., G = DXs, with the consideration of the accurate PAPR
constraints in (73), which is expressed as

where Θe = IL ⊗ Θ ∈ C

ΥNsNtL×(NsNtL+1). Problem (Pb2) has a similar structure to problem (P5) in (52) and
can be optimally solved in a similar way. Moreover, we can
also divide the problem (P2b ) in (77) into L subproblems each
corresponding to one frame/snapshot as in Section III-D, and
then leverage the low-complexity algorithm to obtain the lowPAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform solution by solving L
subproblems parallelly.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, simulation results are given to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods for designing the
low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform in both scenarios
with Nyquist-rate sampling (NS) and oversampling (OS). The
performance comparison for these two cases are given to verify
the necessity of utilizing oversampling in practical OFDM
systems for measuring the PAPR levels of OFDM signals.
The performance results for communications and radar are
analyzed with either communication priority or radar priority
based on the weighting factor ρ, demonstrating the feasibility,
effectiveness, and flexibility of the proposed DFRC waveform
design methods. Also, the performance tradeoff between communications and radar are investigated to show the capability
of the proposed waveform design methods in achieving satisfactory balance between these two functionalities.
In the following figures, the proposed low-PAPR DFRC
MIMO-OFDM waveform design scheme is named as ‘DFRC’
where we consider four different PAPR threshold values:
0.3dB, 1dB, 2dB, 3dB, and one benchmark without PAPR
constraints; The benchmark scheme of desired radar waveform
with directional beampattern design in noted as ‘DirectionalStrict’; Another banchmark scheme of power constrained zero
forcing (ZF) beamforming is denoted as ‘ZF-Power Constrained’, where the power of transmitted ZF waveform is
limited by the same power budget of the ‘DFRC’ scheme.
The unit-power QPSK alphabet is utilized as the constellation
for the communication UEs, and the SNR is defined as Pt/σ2
.
Other basic simulation parameters are listed in Table I unless

A. Performance Comparison for Scenarios with NS and OS
In this subsection, we show the performance comparisons
between the cases with NS and OS discussed in Section III and
Section IV, respectively. In Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4, we depict
the curves of the average sum rate, SER, and radar detection
probability PD of all the schemes versus the weighting ratio
parameter ρ. It is known that the radar function has higher
priority as ρ approaches to 0 while communication function
dominates as ρ approaches to 1.

Fig. 3. The average SER versus ρ for SNR=20dB.
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 present the variation of two important
communication performance metrics: sum rate and SER versus
ρ. From these two figures, we can observe that the average sum
rates of the DFRC scheme increase with ρ while the average
SERs decrease with ρ in both the NS and OS scenarios,
which coincides the intuition that the communication priority
increases with ρ and thus better communication performance
can be achieved with larger ρ. The benchmark performance of
the ZF-Power Constrained and the Directional-Strict schemes
is not affected by ρ. It is easy to note that the communication
performance of sum rates and SERs for the proposed DFRC
scheme degrades to the Directional-Strict scheme when ρ
approaches 0, which operates a desired radar-only waveform
design. Correspondingly, the communication performance approaches to the ZF-Power Constrained scheme as ρ is close
to 1, operating a communication-only waveform design.5

Fig. 4. The average radar detection probability PD versus ρ for SNRR=−4dB.
Fig. 4 shows that the radar detection probability values
PD of the DFRC scheme decreases as ρ increases along
with the design focus transforming from radar priority to
communication priority. Similarly, it demonstrates that the
radar detection performance can catch up the Directional-Strict
scheme when ρ is close 0 while gradually degrades to the ZFPower Constrained scheme as ρ approaches 1. Note that the
proposed DFRC scheme can achieve better radar detection performance (also better sum rate performance as shown in Fig.
2) than the ZF-Power Constrained scheme when ρ approaches
1, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods
for low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform design.
From Fig. 2 to Fig. 4, we can see that better DFRC performance can be achieved with more relaxed PAPR constraints as
PAPR threshold from 0.3dB to 3dB and even without PAPR
constraints. Moreover, it is clearly shown that the gaps between
the DFRC curves with different PAPR constraints are much
wider in the case with OS, indicating that the performance
degradations caused by tightening the PAPR constraints are
more obvious in the case with OS compared to NS. It is known
that high PAPR is a vital disadvantage of the OFDM technique,
and thus the PAPR levels of DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveforms
should be carefully measured and then restrained through
effective low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform design
so as to meet the hardware requirements. In the case with
NS, the measurement of PAPR is less accurate compared with
OS due to insufficient sampling, resulting in a set of compact
DFRC curves even with different PAPR constraints. These
three figures verify the necessity of oversampling in measuring

two cases are both 0, so the curves are not drawn with the log-scale y-axis.
the accurate PAPR levels of OFDM waveforms in practical
systems with low-cost non-linear power amplifiers. Hence, in
the following sub-sections, we will present more simulation
results of low-PAPR MIMO-OFDM waveform design for the
case with OS.
B. More Simulation Results for Communications and Radar
with Oversampling
1) Performance for Communications: In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6,

Fig. 6. The average achievable sum rate and SER versus SNR for radar
priority with ρ=0.2.
From Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, it is easy to observe that the
communication-only ZF-Power Constrained scheme provides
a upper bound while the radar-only Directional-Strict scheme
provides a lower bound for communication performance in
both scenarios with communication priority (ρ = 0.8) and
radar priority (ρ = 0.2). For the case with communication
priority (ρ = 0.8), the communication performance of sum
rate and SER for the DFRC scheme is highly superior to
the Directional-Strict scheme and close to the ZF-Power
Constrained scheme. For the case with radar priority (ρ = 0.2),
the communication performance of sum rate degrades to the
Directional-Strict scheme. The SER performance of the DFRC
scheme with more restrict PAPR constraints such as 0.3dB
and 1dB is worse than the Directional-Strict scheme since
no PAPR constraints are executed for the Directional-Strict
scheme. Both two figures show that average sum rates of
all the schemes gradually saturate as the SNR increases due
to the fact the noise power gradually becomes negligible as
SNR increases considering the fixed limited signal power and
thus MUI dominates leading to the sum rate saturation.6 The
values of SER decreases as SNR increases and the restriction
effects of PAPR constraints on SER performance become more
obvious with the enlarging of SNR.
2) Performance for Radar: In Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, the radar
performance results of detection beampattern are presented in
the scenarios with radar priority (ρ = 0.2) and communication
priority (ρ = 0.8), where three targets of interest with angles
of −π/3, 0 and π/3 are considered. In Fig. 9, we further show
the radar detection probability PD versus ρ in two scenarios
with different radar received target echo SNRR.

The performance of radar beampattern shown in Fig. 7 and
Fig. 8 demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed lowPAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform in detecting targets,
where we can observe that three targets can be clearly distinguished in both the cases with radar priority (ρ = 0.2)
and communication priority (ρ = 0.8). For radar priority
(ρ = 0.2), the beampattern of the proposed DFRC scheme
can well match the desired Directional-Strict scheme and can
be enhanced by relaxed PAPR constraints. Looser beampattern
fit is achieved in the case of communication priority (ρ = 0.8)
but can still achieve satisfactory detection performance. For the

performance of ZF scheme and leads to saturation of sum rate performance

communication-only ZF-Power Constrained scheme, the beam
gains at all directions are almost the same which is impossible
to detect the interested targets. From the comparison of the
DFRC scheme between two sub-figures with different PAPR
thresholds in Fig. 7-8, we can see that better beampattern
match can be achieved with relaxed PAPR constraints.

Fig. 9. The average radar detection probability PD versus ρ for SNRR =
−4dB and SNRR = −2dB.
The performance results of radar detection probability PD
versus ρ are depicted in Fig. 9 with SNRR = −4dB and
SNRR = −2dB. As a crucial radar performance metric, PD is
highly affected by the radar received target echo SNRR, which
is described in Section II-C2. The larger SNRR, the better
radar detection performance can be achieved. For the case of
SNRR = −4dB, PD ≥ 0.8 can be achieved by all the DFRC
curves when ρ ≤ 0.6 even with the strictest PAPR constraint
of 0.3dB, and PD ≥ 0.65 for the case with communication
priority ρ = 0.8. When SNRR increases to −2dB, DFRC
curves are capable to achieve PD ≥ 0.9 for ρ = 0.8 and the
detection probability can always approach 1 as the DirectionalStrict scheme when ρ ≤ 0.6.
C. Performance Tradeoff between Communications and Radar
In this section, we try to analyze the direct performance
tradeoff between functionalities of communications and radar.
The communication results of average sum rate and SER
versus the radar detection probability PD are depicted in Fig.
10 and Fig. 11 for SNRR = −4dB and SNRR = −2dB,
respectively. The six points shown in these two figures correspond to ρ = [0.01, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.99].

Fig. 11. The average achievable communication sum rate and SER for
SER=20dB versus the radar detection probability PD for SNRR=−2dB.
In Fig. 10, we draw two required thresholds for sum rate
and PD in sub-figure (a) and two thresholds for SER and
PD in sub-figure (b). For requirements of (PD,sum rate), the
points located in the top right corner of sub-figure (a) are
satisfactory. In contrast, the points in the bottom right corner of
sub-figure (b) are satisfactory for the (PD,SER) requirements.
Giving the requirements of these three performance metrics for
communications and radar, we can effectively set parameter ρ
satisfying certain PAPR constraints (hardware requirements).
In Fig. 11 with SNRR = −2dB, the PD requirements are
easier to be satisfied since most of the points are located in
the area of PD ≥ 0.8, and thus the satisfactory settings of
ρ and PAPR thresholds can be flexibly selected based on the
requirements of sum rate and SER.

Fig. 12. The empirical CDF of the PAPR (dB) without considering the PAPR
constraints.
In Fig. 12, the empirical CDFs of waveform PAPR for the
proposed DFRC scheme with different ρ values as well as the
two benchmarks are provided, where the PAPR constraints
are not considered. It is clear to see that the PAPR of the
proposed DFRC scheme is within the range of [9,14]dB if no
PAPR constraints are used. For radar priority of ρ approaching
0, the PAPR levels with average value of 12.5dB get close to
the radar-only Directional-Strict scheme with average value
of 13.5dB. For communication priority of ρ close to 1, the
PAPR levels approach to the communication-only ZF-Power
Constrained scheme with average value of 10.5dB. All these
PAPR levels are too high to satisfy the strict hardware requirements in practical communication systems. In comparison with
the simulation results in the previous figures, we can clearly
observe that we can restrain the PAPR levels of the DFRC
waveform to 3dB, 2dB, 1dB and even 0.3dB without too much
performance degradation for both communications and radar,
demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
low-PAPR DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform design methods.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigate the low-PAPR DFRC waveform
design for MIMO-OFDM systems, where the scenario with
Nyquist-rate sampling and oversampling are considered for
measuring the waveform PAPR levels. A weighted objective
function on normalized communication performance metric
MUI and radar performance metric (distance to desired radar
waveform) is minimized under the transmit power and PAPR
constraints. The optimization problems can be transformed
into standard SDP, then the SDR method is leveraged to find
the optimal solution where the rank-1 constraint is satisfied in
general. In addition, low-complexity methods are provided to
reduce the overload for solving the SDP problems where the
original problems are divided into subproblems corresponding
to each frame/snapshot. The simulation results demonstrate
that oversampling on OFDM signals can provide an accurate
way for measuring the PAPR levels. Moreover, the feasibility, effectiveness, and flexibility of the proposed low-PAPR
DFRC MIMO-OFDM waveform design methods are verified
by sufficient numerical simulations.

PROOF OF LEMMA 2
It is easy to observe that the problem (P5) in (52) ignoring
the rank-1 constraint (52g) is a convex optimization problem,
and thus the optimal solution must satisfy the Karush-KuhnTacker (KKT) conditions [36]. We first express the Lagrangian

For the global optimal solution of the considered problem, the
optimal Lagrangian multipliers are uniquely determined.
Here, Πq ∈ R

o
q
for q ∈ NstL. It is easy to
verify that Γbc  0 is also a diagonal matrix with NcNtL
non-zero elements which with the same value of 1, and thus
rank(Γbc) = NcNtL. Hence, we can obtain
Πo + ν
o
I + ̺
oΓbc ≻ 0, (93)
by considering the fact Πo
, ν
o
and ̺
o
are uniquely determined
and the special case of ν
o = 0 rarely occurs. Based on
the definition of Q in (50) and the non-negative property of
objective function (47a), we know that Q  0. Hence, we can
further derive that
Ξ , Q + Πo + ν
o
I + ̺
oΓbc ≻ 0, (94)
which can be verified by contradiction. Assuming that Ξ  0,
there exists at least one vector x ∈ C
(NsNtL+1)×1
such that
x
HΞx ≤ 0, also we have
x
HΨox = x
HΞx − ϕ
ox
HΠNsNtL+1x ≥ 0 (95)
due to the fact that Ψo  0. Considering that ΠNsNtL+1  0
as well, we have x
HΠNsNtL+1x ≥ 0, leading to the results
of x
HΨox = 0, x
HΠNsNtL+1x = 0 and x
HΞx = 0. In
addition, x
HQx ≥ 0, and thus x
H(Πo + ν
o
I + ̺
oΓbc)x =
x
HΞx − x
HQx ≤ 0, which contradicts the result in (93).
Based on the expression (91), we further have
rank(Ψ) ≥ rank(Ξ) − rank(ΠNsNtL+1)
≥ NsNtL + 1 − 1 = NsNtL. (96)
Since Tr
ΨGb

= 0 with Ψ  0 and Gb  0, it follows that
ΨGb = 0 and rank(Ψ) + rank(Gb ) ≤ NsNtL + 1, and thus
rank(Gb ) ≤ NsNtL + 1 − rank(Ψ) ≤ 1. (97)
Also, rank(Gb ) ≥ 1 as it is a non-zero matrix, leading to the
final result of rank(Gb ) = 1.
