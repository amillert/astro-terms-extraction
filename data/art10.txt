Cosmology and neutrino mass with the Minimum Spanning Tree
ABSTRACT
The information content of the minimum spanning tree (MST), used to capture higher-order statistics and other information from
the cosmic web, is compared to that of the power spectrum for a 𝜈ΛCDM model. The measurements are made in redshift space
using haloes from the Quĳote simulation of mass ≥ 3.2 × 1013 ℎ
−1M in a box of length 𝐿box = 1 ℎ
−1Gpc. The power spectrum
multipoles (monopole and quadrupole) are computed for Fourier modes in the range 0.006 < 𝑘 < 0.5 ℎMpc−1
. For comparison
the MST is measured with a minimum length scale of 𝑙min ' 13 ℎ
−1Mpc. Combining the MST and power spectrum allows for
many of the individual degeneracies to be broken; on its own the MST provides tighter constraints on the sum of neutrino masses
𝑀𝜈, Hubble constant ℎ, spectral tilt 𝑛s
, and baryon energy density Ωb but the power spectrum alone provides tighter constraints
on Ωm and 𝜎8. The power spectrum on its own gives a standard deviation of 0.25 eV on 𝑀𝜈 while the combination of power
spectrum and MST gives 0.11 eV. There is similar improvement of a factor of two for ℎ, 𝑛s
, and Ωb. These improvements appear
to be driven by the MST’s sensitivity to small scale clustering, where the effect of neutrino free-streaming becomes relevant.
The MST is shown to be a powerful tool for cosmology and neutrino mass studies, and therefore could play a pivotal role in
ongoing and future galaxy redshift surveys (such as DES, DESI, Euclid, and Rubin-LSST).
Key words: neutrinos – cosmological parameters – large scale structure of Universe
1 INTRODUCTION
The Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) paradigm has remained at the
forefront of cosmology for over twenty years, cementing it as the
standard cosmological model. Observations and simulations over
that time have largely strengthened the case for ΛCDM despite the
model consisting overwhelmingly of things we still do not understand – principally the nature of dark matter and dark energy. While
understanding the former will most likely need significant contributions from particle physics experiments, understanding the latter is
a key goal for future experiments in cosmology. The next generation of galaxy redshift surveys (such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI),1 Euclid,
2
the Nancy Grace Roman Space
Telescope,3
the Prime Focus Spectrograph,4
the Rubin Observatory
Legacy Survey of Space and Time,5
and the 4-metre Multi-Object
Spectroscopic Telescope6
) will map the positions of hundreds of millions of galaxies. Determining the nature of dark energy is a major
scientific mission for these surveys. In ΛCDM dark energy is simply
Einstein’s cosmological constant (resulting from a scalar field), but

better data may reveal that dark energy is actually changing with time
(dynamical dark energy) or that the requirement for dark energy is
actually a symptom that General Relativity, on which these models
are based, is incomplete and requires modification (the premise of
Modified Gravity theories).
The discovery of neutrino oscillation (Fukuda et al. 1998; Ahmad
et al. 2001) provided evidence that neutrinos are not massless (as
had been predicted by the standard model of particle physics). This
discovery makes neutrinos of keen interest to particle physicists,
as the origins of their mass and hierarchy could provide hints to
new physics. Particle physics experiments currently place a lower
bound on the sum of neutrino masses (denoted in this work by 𝑀𝜈)
of 𝑀𝜈 & 0.06 eV. However, it is cosmological experiments that
provide the tightest upper bound: currently 𝑀𝜈 . 0.11 eV (95%
confidence level (CL); Planck Collaboration et al. 2018; eBOSS
Collaboration et al. 2020); by contrast the upper bound from particle
physics experiment KATRIN is currently 𝑀𝜈 ≤ 1.1 eV (90% CL;
Aker et al. 2019) (although unlike cosmological measurements this is
model independent). The sensitivity to neutrino mass in cosmology
comes from the role neutrinos play in the growth of large scale
structure (LSS). The neutrino’s characteristic free-streaming length,
a quantity dependent on its mass, will wash out small scale structure.
This effect can be quantified as a suppression of small scale modes
in the power spectrum. Over the next five years surveys such as DESI
expect to be sensitive to 𝑀𝜈 . 0.06 eV (95% CL; Font-Ribera et al.

non-zero mass for neutrinos.
Cosmological surveys have largely focused on two-point statistics,
whether in real or Fourier space. While these methods are triedand-tested, they fail to fully explore and capture all the information
content of galaxy surveys. This is particularly relevant at low redshifts where the highly non-linear structure of the cosmic web is
very pronounced; here the distribution of matter cannot be fully
characterised by two-point statistics and further statistical methods
are required if we are to fully extract all the information present.
Such analyses are particularly timely as future data sets will probe
the Universe with tracers (galaxies, quasars, etc.) at higher number
densities providing a greater sensitivity to the cosmic web. Relevant
statistical methods include the three-point correlation function (the
Bispectrum in Fourier space; e.g. Gil-Marín et al. 2017; Gualdi et al.
2019), Minkowski functionals (e.g. Petri et al. 2013), the 1D probability distribution function (Uhlemann et al. 2019), marked power
spectra (Massara et al. 2020), machine learning (ML; e.g. Fluri et al.
2018), and the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST; Naidoo et al. 2020)
– the focus of this paper.
The MST was first introduced to astronomy by Barrow et al. (1985)
and has successfully been used as a filament finder for cosmic web
studies (Bhavsar & Ling 1988; van de Weygaert et al. 1992; Bhavsar
& Splinter 1996; Krzewina & Saslaw 1996; Ueda & Itoh 1997; Coles
et al. 1998; Adami & Mazure 1999; Colberg 2007; Alpaslan et al.
2014; Beuret et al. 2017; Libeskind et al. 2018). The MST is the minimum weighted graph that connects a set of points without forming
loops. More recently Naidoo et al. (2020) investigated how the MST
could be used to incorporate the cosmic web when constraining cosmological parameters. However, unlike the conventional two-point
analysis as performed by most galaxy redshift surveys, reference
MST values cannot be calculated analytically and instead need to be
calculated from simulations. Fortunately, this problem is not unique
to the MST – conventional statistics such as the power spectrum
and bispectrum cannot be computed analytically in the non-linear
regime (for Fourier modes 𝑘 & 0.3 ℎMpc−1
) and hence require simulations, as do artificial intelligence (AI) and ML algorithms (as well
as other algorithms used to measure non-linear features in the cosmic
web). This has created a growing demand for large suites of cosmological simulations and the development of accurate emulators as
cosmologists push to extract more information from the distribution
of galaxies.
The Quĳote simulations (Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2019) were
designed precisely for this use (i.e. to test new summary statistics
such as the MST and AI/ML and to push conventional statistics to
smaller scales). In this paper we will use these simulations to measure
the information content of the MST. The simulations have previously
been used to conduct Fisher matrix analysis for the power spectrum
(Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2019), bispectrum (Hahn et al. 2019), 1D
probability distribution function (Uhlemann et al. 2019), and marked
power spectrum (Massara et al. 2020). In this paper we extend this
analysis to the MST; in Naidoo et al. (2020) the MST was tested
against measurements of the power spectrum and bispectrum for a
few parameters (matter density Ωm, amplitude of scalar fluctuations
𝐴s, and neutrino mass 𝑀𝜈) to test whether the MST adds new information. Fisher matrix analysis is useful in cosmology as it places a
lower bound (the Cramer-Rao bound; Rao 1945; Cramer 1946) on the
uncertainty of cosmological parameters inferred from a given statistic. If the posterior distribution is Gaussian then the Fisher matrix
constraints will be realised; otherwise the constraints on any given
parameter will be weaker. This analysis is explored for parameters
of the 𝜈ΛCDM model (i.e. the standard model of cosmology ΛCDM
+ massive neutrinos 𝑀𝜈). This will help determine the role that the
MST can play in constraining parameters from the current and next
generation of galaxy surveys.
The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we discuss the
methodology and data used. In section 3 we present the constraints
from components of the MST and demonstrate how including the
MST together with measurements of the power spectrum improves
parameter constraints in a 𝜈ΛCDM model. Finally in section 4 we
discuss the main results and their implications for cosmology and
future surveys.
2 METHOD
In this section we explain the Fisher matrix formalism used to measure the information content of several summary statistics, we explain how we measure the power spectrum multipoles and the MST
statistics in redshift space, and we describe properties of the Quĳote
simulations used in this analysis.
2.1 Fisher Formalism
The Fisher matrix (Tegmark et al. 1997) 𝐹 is defined to have elements
𝐹𝑖 𝑗 =
∑︁
𝛼,𝛽
𝜕𝑆𝛼
𝜕𝜃𝑖
𝐶
−1
𝛼,𝛽
𝜕𝑆𝛽
𝜕𝜃 𝑗
, (1)
where 𝑆𝛼 and 𝑆𝛽 are the elements 𝛼 and 𝛽 of the data vector 𝑆, C is
the sample covariance matrix defined to have elements
𝐶𝑖 𝑗 = h(𝑆𝑖 − h𝑆𝑖i)

𝑆 𝑗 − h𝑆 𝑗i

i, (2)
and 𝜃𝑖 and 𝜃 𝑗 are parameters 𝑖 and 𝑗 of the model. We multiply
the inverse of the covariance matrix by the Kaufman-Hartlap factor
(Kaufman 1967; Hartlap et al. 2007) (𝑁sim − 2 − 𝑁S)/(𝑁sim − 1)
where 𝑁S is the length of the data vector 𝑆 and 𝑁sim is the number of
simulations used to estimate the covariance matrix; this compensates
for the error in the sample covariance estimation.
When reference summary statistics are available analytically, the
partial derivatives in the Fisher matrix are straightforward to estimate. However, for some summary statistics (such as the MST)
where reference values must be obtained via simulations, the partial
derivatives must be estimated numerically; typically we use
𝜕𝑆
𝜕𝜃 '
𝑆(𝜃 + 𝑑𝜃) − 𝑆(𝜃 − 𝑑𝜃)
2𝑑𝜃
+ O(𝑑𝜃2
), (3)
where 𝑑𝜃 is a small deviation from a fiducial 𝜃. We cannot use
this when estimating the partial derivative with respect to neutrino
mass when this mass is zero, as this would require simulations with
negative neutrino mass; instead here we use one of the estimators

These non-symmetric estimators are designed to use simulations with
𝑀𝜈 = 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 eV (in addition to 𝑀𝜈 = 0). In this case the

2.2 Summary Statistics in Real and Redshift Space
In redshift space, redshift space distortions (RSD; Kaiser 1987)
caused by peculiar velocities alter the observed redshifts of galaxies.
This causes a line-of-sight (LOS) shift given by
𝑥RSD = 𝑥 +
1 + 𝑧
𝐻(𝑧)
(𝑣 · 𝑒), (12)
where 𝑥 is the real space coordinate, 𝑥RSD is the redshift space
coordinate, 𝑣 is the peculiar velocity, 𝑧 is the redshift, 𝐻(𝑧) is the
Hubble expansion rate at redshift 𝑧, and 𝑒 is the unit vector defining
the LOS. In this paper the LOS is taken to be the z-axis, so that
𝑒 = (0, 0, 1).
2.2.1 Power Spectrum Multipoles
The density field is reexpressed in Fourier space; let 𝑘 = (𝑘x, 𝑘y, 𝑘z)
be a Fourier mode vector. We bin the density field by 𝑘 = |𝑘 | and
𝜇 = 𝑘z/𝑘 (the cosine of the angle between 𝑘 and the LOS 𝑒).
The power spectrum multipoles are
𝑃ℓ
(𝑘) = (2ℓ + 1) Z1
0
𝑃(𝑘, 𝜇)Lℓ
(𝜇)𝑑𝜇, (13)
where Lℓ
is a Legendre polynomial. The monopole and quadrupole
are 𝑃0 and 𝑃2 respectively.
2.2.2 Masking Small Scales by Grouping
Masking of small scales is done by grouping two haloes if their
separation is less than 𝑙min = 2𝜋/𝑘max = 4𝜋 ℎ−1Mpc ' 13 ℎ
−1Mpc
(equivalent to the maximum Fourier mode 𝑘max = 0.5 ℎMpc−1 measured for the power spectrum). The grouping is transitive (if 𝐴 and 𝐵
are close, and 𝐵 and 𝐶 are close, then all three are grouped together

the deviations from the fiducial cosmological parameters. We use the standard
and paired-fixed simulations for each set of simulations.

regardless of the distance between 𝐴 and 𝐶); as a result, 𝑙min meeds
to be set well below the mean separation of points (to avoid the entire catalogue collapsing to one point). A group of haloes is given
coordinates equal to the mean coordinates of its constituent haloes.
This process yields a catalogue of nodes (a collection of grouped
and ungrouped haloes); on average this node catalogue is about one
quarter the size of the original halo catalogue. See Appendix A for
evidence that this masking technique is effective.
2.2.3 Minimum Spanning Tree Statistics
The MST is constructed, in 3D comoving coordinates in redshift
space, from the node catalogue. The distribution function 𝑁(𝑥) of
the MST statistics is measured, where 𝑥 is the degree 𝑑, edge length
𝑙, branch length 𝑏, or branch shape 𝑠 (Naidoo et al. 2020). An edge is
a line in the MST graph, the degree is the number of edges attached to
each node, and a branch is a chain of edges connected continuously
by nodes of degree 𝑑 = 2. For the branches we measure their length 𝑏
(i.e. the sum of the lengths of member edges) and their shape 𝑠(i.e. the
square root of one minus the ratio between the straight line distance
between branch ends and the branch length – with this definition,
straighter branches have 𝑠 ' 0 while larger values indicate more
curved branches). Furthermore, to ensure 𝑁(𝑥) can be described by a
Gaussian distribution we remove the tails of the distribution function.
We measure the mean of the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of 𝑁(𝑥) for the fiducial simulations and then measure the MST 𝑁(𝑥)
only in the region where 0.05 < CDF < 0.95 (with the exception
of 𝑑 where we include 𝑁(𝑑) in the range 1 ≤ 𝑑 ≤ 4). The publicly
available Python package MiSTree (Naidoo 2019) was used to
construct and measure the statistics of the MST.
2.3 Quĳote Simulations
The Quĳote simulations (Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2019) are a large
set of 𝑁-body simulations designed for quantifying the information
content of cosmological observables and for training ML algorithms.
The simulations are constructed in boxes of length 𝐿box = 1 ℎ
−1Gpc,
using 5123 dark matter particles and 5123 neutrino particles (for simulations with massive neutrinos). A detailed table of the parameters
used for the Quĳote simulations can be found in Tab. 1 of VillaescusaNavarro et al. (2019). The simulations are based on a fiducial ΛCDM
cosmology (based on Planck Collaboration et al. 2018) with matter

Figure 1. Correlation matrices (left) of MST statistics and (right) of MST statistics and power spectrum multipoles. The components of the MST statistics (the
degree 𝑑, edge length 𝑙, branch length 𝑏, and branch shape 𝑠) are labelled and divided by dashed grey lines on the left. The matrix has significant non-diagonal
features. The most striking is the correlation between the edge length 𝑙 and branch length 𝑏 where there are several fading lines of positive correlation. These
originate from correlations between branches formed from two edges, three edges and so on, becoming fainter for branches formed from more edges. For the
degree 𝑑 and 𝑙 there is virtually no correlation while there are correlations between 𝑑 and the two branch statistics length 𝑏 and shape 𝑠. These correlations
appear to be strongly tied to 𝑑 = 2 presumably due to the definition for branches requiring intermediate nodes with degree 𝑑 = 2. Lastly there is a weak
correlation between 𝑏 and 𝑠 and negligible correlations between other MST statistics (i.e. between 𝑙 and 𝑑 and between 𝑙 and 𝑠). The power spectrum multipoles
and components of the MST statistic are divided by a dashed grey lines on the right. The correlation matrix for the power spectrum multipoles is shown to be
strongest diagonally, with the most striking feature being the positive correlations between multipoles. Correlations between the power spectrum multipoles and
the MST are negligible with only a small inverse correlation seen. This is consistent with expectations since smaller edge lengths should correspond to larger
Fourier modes.

For each parameter we determine the dependence on that parameter
using 500 simulations in which only that parameter deviates from
its fiducial value (while maintaining zero curvature, i.e. a shift in
Ωm =⇒ ΩΛ = 1 − Ωm). To construct the covariance matrix we use
15,000 fiducial simulations constructed with the fiducial cosmology. See Tab. 1 for a summary. Simulations with massive neutrinos
(𝑀+

, 𝑀++
𝜈
, and 𝑀+++
𝜈
) are produced with Zel’dovich initial conditions instead of second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT)
since the 2LPT approach is not implemented for massive neutrino
cosmologies (for further details see Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2019).
3 RESULTS
This Section discusses the following results: (1) the covariance matrix
for the MST statistics and the internal correlations and correlations
with the power spectrum, (2) the partial derivatives of the power spectrum and MST statistics, and (3) parameter constraints for a 𝜈ΛCDM
model obtained from individual and combined measurements of the
MST and power spectrum.
3.1 Covariance Matrix
The covariance matrix is constructed from Eq. 2 using data vectors
measured from 15,000 fiducial simulations. Fig. 1 shows the correlation matrix for the MST on the left and the correlation matrix
for the combined data vector of the power spectrum multipoles and
MST statistics on the right. Unlike the correlation matrix for the
power spectrum, the correlation matrix for the MST contains several non-diagonal features. One of the most striking features is the
correlation between the edge length 𝑙 and branch length 𝑏 which
show ‘waves’ of positive correlations between short edges and short
branches followed by negative correlations and then positive correlation for longer edges and branches. These positive correlations stem
from the correlations between branches formed from two edges, three
edges, and so on. For branches formed from more edges these correlations become weaker as branches formed from more than three
edges are rarer. Other correlations in the MST statistics appear to
stem from branches, which by definition have intermediate nodes
with degree 𝑑 = 2. As a result we see strong correlations between
the degree and branch length. The correlation between branch length
and shape is weak but indicates that longer branches are more curved
than short ones. The correlations between the power spectrum multipoles and MST are weak so adding the MST to 𝑃(𝑘) is beneficial.
This is clearest for the monopole and edge lengths which show an
inverse correlation between edges and Fourier modes; this is completely consistent with the relation between Fourier modes and real
space. Furthermore the large scale modes of the monopole (the first
half of the data vector) show positive correlations with longer edges.
This indicates that most of the large scale clustering information is
stored in the large edges of the MST.

Figure 2. Fisher matrix constraints for 𝜈ΛCDM parameters from the MST edge and branch length distributions in combination with the distribution of degree
and branch shape in redshift space at 𝑧 = 0. The individual constraints from the edge MST(𝑙) and branch length distributions MST(𝑏) are shown in blue and
purple respectively. The combined constraint from the edge and branch lengths MST(𝑙, 𝑏) is shown with black dashed lines, from the edge, branch length and
degree distributions MST(𝑙, 𝑏, 𝑠) with green lines, and from the edge, branch length, degree and branch shape distribution MST(𝑑, 𝑙, 𝑏, 𝑠) with red lines and
contours. The contours show that adding the degree does very little to improve the constraints from the edge and branch length distribution while the branch
shape tightens constraints overall.
3.2 Fisher Matrix and Partial Derivatives
The Fisher matrix is calculated from Eq. 1 from the data vector
𝑆. In this Section the data vectors are either the power spectrum
monopole and quadrupole 𝑃ℓ=0,2(𝑘) or combinations of the MST
statistics: degree 𝑑, edge length 𝑙, branch length 𝑏, and branch shape
𝑠. To calculate the Fisher matrix we require measurements of the
derivatives 𝜕𝑆/𝜕𝜃; these are estimated using simulations summarised
in Tab. 1. For each set of simulations (consisting of 500 individual
simulations and 15,000 simulations for the fiducial set) the mean
and standard deviation of the summary statistics are obtained. The
derivatives for the parameters are then obtained using Eq. 3, with the
exception of neutrino mass where three estimators are used (Eqs. 4,
5, and 6). In real data we would not be able to place a clean cut on
the galaxy masses; instead, these limits would be imposed by survey
designs and magnitude limits. To account for this in our analysis
we follow Hahn et al. (2019) by adding the nuisance parameter
𝑀min which characterises the dependence on the minimum halo mass
which is calculated by running the statistics on the fiducial suite with
𝑀min = 3.1 and 𝑀min = 3.3 ×1013ℎ
−1M. However, unlike in the
study by Hahn et al. (2019) we do not include a linear bias nuisance
parameter (as it is not clear how a linear bias would effect the MST
statistics and including it solely in the power spectrum measurements
would weaken the constraints in the power spectrum but leave the
MST unaffected, in effect biasing our results in favour of the MST).
To avoid this we use only the minimum halo mass as a nuisance
parameter in this study.
The more accurate estimators for the partial derivatives are those
for which the errors are given to higher orders of 𝑑𝜃. For most
parameters the derivative 𝜕𝑆/𝜕𝜃 is determined by the symmetric
derivative estimator Eq. 3 which has errors of order O(𝑑𝜃2
), while
the most accurate estimator for 𝜕𝑆/𝜕𝑀𝜈 is given by Eq. 6 which

Figure 3. Fisher matrix constraints on 𝜈ΛCDM parameters from the power spectrum and MST separately and combined in redshift space at 𝑧 = 0. The
constraints from the power spectrum multipoles 𝑃ℓ=0,2(𝑘) are shown with blue dashed lines, from the four MST statistics MST(𝑑, 𝑙, 𝑏, 𝑠) with red dotted lines,
and from the combination of the power spectrum multipoles and MST 𝑃ℓ=0,2(𝑘) + MST(𝑑, 𝑙, 𝑏, 𝑠) with purple lines and contours. Constraints for 𝜎8 and Ωm
are dominated by the power spectrum multipoles while ℎ, 𝑛s, Ωb, and 𝑀𝜈 are dominated by the MST. Significant degeneracies are broken when combined,
leading to much tighter constraints (in comparison to the individual constraints from the power spectrum multipoles) on ℎ, 𝑛s, and Ωb (which improve by ∼ 2.4)
and 𝑀𝜈 (which improves by ∼ 2.26).
has errors of order O(𝑑𝜃3
). However, in order for the estimators
to be consistent for all parameters the appropriate estimator to use
for 𝑀𝜈 is Eq. 5 which has errors of order O(𝑑𝜃2
). Previous studies
(Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2019; Uhlemann et al. 2019; Hahn et al.
2019) have used Eq. 6 (while Massara et al. 2020 uses Eq. 5), so to
facilitate comparisons to these studies the results obtained using this
estimator are additionally provided in Tab. C2. However, throughout
this paper we will refer to results obtained using Eq. 5 with 𝑑𝑀𝜈 =
0.1 eV. The partial derivatives for the data vectors (as a function of
the 𝜈ΛCDM parameters Ωm, Ωb
, ℎ, 𝑛s, 𝜎8, and 𝑀𝜈) are shown in
appendix B.
3.3 MST Bin Size Dependence
We test the sensitivity of the MST distribution functions to the bin
size. In real data the size of bins would be dictated by numerical
constraints, i.e. the number of mocks used to obtain the covariance
matrices and the sample size. Since the suite used to estimate the
covariance matrix is large we do not need to keep the data vector
short and therefore can test the sensitivity to the MST distribution
function’s bin size. To this end we use three binning strategies for
the distribution functions of 𝑙, 𝑏 and 𝑠, with 𝑁bins = 200, 100, and
40 bins. The constraints from the different binning strategies are
described and discussed in the following sections (in particular see
Fig. 4).
3.4 Sensitivity to Neutrinos and ΛCDM
In this Section the forecast constraints (derived from Fisher matrices)
for parameters of a 𝜈ΛCDM universe are obtained and discussed.

Figure 4. The one dimensional parameter constraints from the MST statistics individually and in combination with the power spectrum multipoles (measured
at redshift 𝑧 = 0). From left to right we show the constraints on the cosmological parameters of the 𝜈ΛCDM model: Ωm, Ωb, ℎ, 𝑛s, 𝜎8, and 𝑀𝜈. From top
to bottom we show the constraints for the individual MST statistics: edge length MST(𝑙) and branch length MST(𝑏), then constraints from the combined MST
statistics: edge and branch length MST(𝑙, 𝑏), with the addition of branch shape MST(𝑙, 𝑏, 𝑠) and with the addition of the degree MST(𝑑, 𝑙, 𝑏, 𝑠), and finally
in combination with the power spectrum: first showing the power spectrum multipoles alone 𝑃ℓ=0,2(𝑘) (these are marked with blue envelopes for comparison
to the other statistics) and in combination 𝑃ℓ=0,2(𝑘) + MST(𝑑, 𝑙, 𝑏, 𝑠). These are further subdivided for constraints involving the MST with different binning
schemes 𝑁bins: 200 bins is shown with a dark coloured error bar at the top, 100 bins is shown with slightly paler coloured error bars in the middle and 40 bins
is shown with the palest coloured error bars at the bottom. These results indicate the significance that binning will have on the individual MST constraints; they
also show that, regardless of binning, combining MST statistics with the power spectrum significantly improves constraints for Ωb, ℎ, 𝑛s, and 𝑀𝜈.
3.4.1 Constraints from the Minimum Spanning Tree
In Fig. 2 the individual and combined constraints from the edge
length 𝑙, branch length 𝑏, branch shape 𝑠, and degree 𝑑 distributions
are shown using 𝑙, 𝑏, and 𝑠 with 𝑁bins = 200. The edge and branch
length distributions have constraints that are competitive with each
other but that in combination are significantly tighter. In augmenting
the constraints first with the branch shape and then with the degree
we see that much of the constraining power for the MST is contained
in the edge and branch length distribution; the addition of the branch
shape adds a modest improvement to the overall constraints (∼ 25%
for cosmological parameters at 𝑧 = 0) but the addition of the degree
appears to provide a negligible improvement (∼ 1% for cosmological
parameters at 𝑧 = 0).
3.4.2 Combined Constraints from the Minimum Spanning Tree and
Power Spectrum
The separate and combined constraints from the MST (using 𝑙, 𝑏,
and 𝑠 with 𝑁bins = 200) and power spectrum measured at redshift
𝑧 = 0 are shown in Fig. 3 (for the constraints obtained from different
redshifts refer to Tab. C2). The constraints obtained for Ωb
, ℎ, 𝑛s,
and neutrino mass 𝑀𝜈 are significantly tighter for the MST, while the
power spectrum yields better constraints on Ωm and𝜎8.When the two
are combined, significant degeneracies are broken leading to much
tighter constraints than those obtained using either statistic alone.
For neutrino mass 𝑀𝜈 the combination provides a 1𝜎 constraint that
is 2.26× tighter, for Ωm that is 1.17× tighter, for Ωb
that is 2.38×
tighter, for ℎ that 2.61× tighter, for 𝑛s that is 2.29× tighter, and for
𝜎8 that is 1.1× tighter.
The impact of the MST binning is explored in Fig. 4, where we
display the one dimensional constraints for the MST statistics (individually and for different combinations) at redshift 𝑧 = 0 in comparison to the power spectrum multipoles with different levels of
binning. Larger bins are associated with poorer constraints but in
each case combining with the power spectrum still leads to significant improvements in the constraints, particularly for Ωb
, ℎ, 𝑛s, and
𝑀𝜈. This highlights the importance of including the MST in future
galaxy redshift surveys to test and constrain ΛCDM parameters and
to determine the sum of neutrino mass 𝑀𝜈 – a key scientific goal of
many future surveys.
3.4.3 Sensitivity to the Neutrino Partial Derivative Estimator

less accurate estimators are associated with poorer constraints. The
most accurate estimators, i.e. estimator 2 and 3 with 𝑀𝜈 = 0.1 eV,

Figure 5. The constraints on neutrino mass from different partial derivative estimates for the MST and power spectrum measured at redshift 𝑧 = 0
(individually and in combination). The MST statistics are shown with three
binning schemes (𝑁bins = 200, 100 and 40). The constraints are given as a
function of the order of the absolute error on 𝜕𝑆/𝜕𝑀𝜈. Estimator 1 is given
by Eq. 4, Estimator 2 by Eq. 5, and Estimator 3 by Eq. 6. The estimators are
indicated by shaded grey lines with the value of 𝑀𝜈 used for each estimator
labelled. With the exception of the 40 bins data, the MST consistently outperforms the power spectrum constraints. However, irrespective of the bin size,
significant improvements in the constraints of neutrino mass are obtained
when combining the MST with the power spectrum.
are shown to be fairly consistent, with estimator 3 generally providing tighter constraints. Without prior knowledge of the true partial
derivative it is difficult to know which estimator better captures the
true behaviour. For consistency we focus on the results from estimator 2 (with 𝑀𝜈 = 0.1 eV) which has the same absolute errors as
the estimator used on the other parameters (Eqs. 3). Nevertheless as
is shown in Fig. 5 the relative strengths of the constraints from the
power spectrum and MST individually and combined remains, meaning our overall conclusions are insensitive to the neutrino derivative
estimator used.
In all cases the MST constraints on 𝑀𝜈 are stronger than ones
obtained from the power spectrum. If more bins are used for the
MST then the combined constraints with the power spectrum are
significantly improved in comparison to the power spectrum alone.
4 CONCLUSION
Using haloes from the Quĳote simulations we calculate the information content (from the Fisher matrix) of the MST statistics in a
𝜈ΛCDM model. The Quĳote simulations are a large suite of 𝑁-body
simulations designed to test the information content of summary
statistics and to test AI/ML algorithms. In this paper we use a subset
of the full suite of simulations (summarised in Tab. 1), measuring the
power spectrum multipoles and MST statistics in redshift space on
haloes with mass ≥ 3.1×1013 ℎ
−1M. The analysis presented in this
paper is based on the Fisher matrix formalism which considers only
second derivatives of the data vector, rather than a full exploration of
the parameter space via for e.g. MCMC. Fisher matrices are limited in
the sense that they place only lower bounds (the Cramer-Rao bound)
on the uncertainties of cosmological parameters; as such analysis on
real data is likely to depart significantly due to non-Gaussianities
(see Hawken et al. 2012; Foroozan et al. 2021).
From the MST we measure the distribution of degree 𝑑, edge length
𝑙, branch length 𝑏, and branch shape 𝑠. In Naidoo et al. (2020) it was
shown that 𝑙 is the most constraining MST statistic. However, this
previous analysis was based on COLA simulations of length 𝐿box =
250 ℎ
−1Mpc and limited to the most massive 5000 haloes. Due to
the size of the sample, the study saw only modest improvements of
17% on the 1𝜎 constraints on Ωm and 12% on the 1𝜎 constraints
on 𝐴s. By using the Quĳote simulations we are able to expand this
analysis to a wider set of cosmological parameters (Ωm, Ωb
, ℎ, 𝑛s,
𝜎8, and 𝑀𝜈 compared to only 𝐴s, Ωm, and 𝑀𝜈), over a larger volume
(𝐿box = 1 ℎ
−1Gpc), and using a larger catalogue of haloes (of the
order of 105
). In Fig. 2 the constraints from the MST are shown to be
dominated by the distribution of edge and branch lengths, with the
degree adding very little information and the branch shape providing
a moderate improvement overall.
In Fig. 3 and Tab. C2 the MST and power spectrum constraints are
compared and combined. The power spectrum multipoles provide
much stronger constraints on Ωm and 𝜎8. On the other hand the MST
dominates the constraints on 𝑀𝜈: at 𝑧 = 0 the power spectrum multipoles gives Δ𝑀𝜈 = 0.25 eV (1𝜎), the MST gives Δ𝑀𝜈 = 0.13 eV
(1𝜎), and the power spectrum multipoles and the MST combined
give Δ𝑀𝜈 = 0.11 eV – an improvement of a factor of ∼ 2.3. For
the other parameters we find that combining the two sets of statistics
breaks several degeneracies and thereby improves constraints on ℎ,
𝑛s, and Ωb by a factor of ∼ 2.4 in comparison to the individual power
spectrum constraints. We measure the dependence on the number of
bins 𝑁bins, showing that fewer bins will decrease the constraining
power but that the inclusion of the MST will, irrespective of the bin
number, significantly improve constraints on Ωb
, ℎ, 𝑛s, and neutrino
mass 𝑀𝜈.
In this paper we show that adding the MST to the power spectrum greatly improves constraints for parameters of the 𝜈ΛCDM
model. In particular constraints on 𝑀𝜈 are dominated by the MST
since it is significantly more sensitive to the effects of neutrinos on
the distribution of haloes. This appears to come from the MST’s
sensitivity to the small scale clustering in the cosmic web where
neutrino free-streaming effects are important. Future galaxy surveys
such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST are projected to bring the upper
limit on neutrino mass below or close to 0.06 eV (Font-Ribera et al.
2014), the lower limit from neutrino oscillations (assuming normal
hierarchy). As we have illustrated using halo simulations the MST
can improve by a factor of two the constraints on neutrino mass
with respect to just the power spectrum. Therefore we can expect
the MST to provide greater constraints from current and future surveys, possibly enabling this interesting regime to be probed sooner.
These constraints could be further improved by combining the MST
and the power spectrum with other probes such as the CMB. This
demonstrates the importance of measuring more than just the power
spectrum (or two-point statistics) and provides a powerful argument
for making measurements of the MST on current and future galaxy
surveys such as BOSS, eBOSS, and DESI. In future work we will look
to develop techniques for addressing the challenges associated with
real galaxy survey data; these challenges include the impact of the
survey’s selection function across the sky (completeness and depth)
and as a function of redshift, the incorporation of galaxy weights,

APPENDIX A: MASKING SMALL SCALES USING
GROUPS
Cosmological simulations tend to suffer from inaccuracies at small
scales due to limitations in resolution and complex baryonic effects
which require expensive hydrodynamics simulations. For these reasons it is important to be able to remove these troublesome scales
from our analysis. For traditional N-point statistics this is relatively
straightforward as this simply requires placing scale cuts on the data
vector. However the MST is different as there is no way to mask small
scales once the MST has been constructed; instead, the input data
vector needs to be prepared such that scales are not present when the
MST is constructed. To remove these scales from our analysis we
implement a grouping scheme where points separated by less than
𝑙min are combined.
In this section we investigate the effectiveness of masking small
scales by grouping using two Levy-Flight simulations as a proxy
for N-body simulations with accurate and inaccurate small scale
effects (such as baryonic effects). These simulations were chosen
as their clustering properties are relatively simple to control and
are fast to generate. We generate 50 realisations of two Levy Flight
simulation models: (1) the standard Levy Flight (LF) and (2) the
Adjusted Levy Flight (ALF; see Naidoo et al. 2020, for more details).
The simulations are generated using MiSTree (Naidoo 2019). For
each simulation 50,000 points are generated in a box of length 75
with parameters 𝑡0 = 0.24 and 𝛼 = 1.6 for the LF simulations and
parameters 𝑡0 = 0.325, 𝑡𝑠 = 0.015, 𝛼 = 1.5, 𝛽 = 0.45, and 𝛾 = 1.3
for the ALF.
The 2-point correlation function (2PCF) and MST statistics are
measured for both simulations and compared in Fig. A1. The simulations are designed to exhibit very different small scale properties
but identical large scale correlation functions.
All points in the simulations with separations less than 0.4 are
grouped and replaced by a single point with the average position of
the group members. A new catalogue of points is now constructed
with these grouped points and any remaining ungrouped points. For
both simulations this results in a catalogue of roughly ∼ 13, 000
points. To ensure differences between the statistics are not due to
slight differences in density we sample at random 12,000 points from
each catalogue and measure the 2PCF and MST statistics. In Fig A1
the statistics before and after grouping are shown. Prior to grouping
the simulations exhibit different small scale clustering properties,
which is seen by differences in the 2PCF and MST statistics, while
after grouping all the statistics are consistent with each other. This
shows that grouping effectively masks the small scale differences
between the simulations.

Figure A1. The effect of grouping Levy Flight simulations are shown for the 2-point correlation function (2PCF) and MST statistics. Two sets of Levy Flight
simulations are used: the standard Levy Flight (LF) simulations are shown in blue and the adjusted Levy Flight (ALF) simulations are shown in red. They exhibit
almost identical large scale 2PCF 𝜉(𝑟) by design but have very different small scale correlation properties. The differences between the ungrouped simulations
are shown in the top subpanels. On the left is the 2PCF and on the right are the four MST statistics degree (𝑑), edge length (𝑙), branch shape (𝑠), and branch length
(𝑏). The differences between the grouped simulations are shown in the bottom subpanels. On the left is the 2PCF and on the right are the four MST statistics 𝑑,
𝑙, 𝑠, and 𝑏. These plots show that grouping provides an effective solution for masking small scales as the small scale differences between the simulations do not
appear once grouping has been performed.
APPENDIX B: MINIMUM SPANNING TREE PARTIAL
DERIVATIVES
The partial derivative estimates for the MST statistics are shown for
the distribution of degree 𝑑 in Fig. B1, for the distribution of edges
𝑙 in Fig. B2, for the distribution of branches 𝑏 in Fig. B3, and for
the distribution of branch shapes 𝑠 in Fig. B4. Depending on the
estimators used the error bars are calculated using either Eq. 7 or 9.
The derivatives for neutrino mass are shown for estimator 2 (Eq. 5)
with 𝑀𝜈 = 0.1 eV.
For a fixed MST statistic, the partial derivatives of that statistic
(with respect to the various cosmological parameters) all have similar shapes. The similarity can be explained if we think about the
construction of the MST as an optimisation problem: differences
in parameters will lead to trees with longer (poorly optimised) or
shorter edges (highly optimised). Depending on the outcome the
MST statistics will to first order be pulled to smaller or larger values
but since there are roughly the same number of points this change
has to be counter balanced with a reduction in the opposite direction.
Although the profiles are similar in their general shape if we instead
look to the relative peaks and troughs with respect to zero we can
see that each parameter behaves slightly differently; take for example
the partial derivatives for edge length with respect to Ωm and 𝑀min
where the troughs for 𝑀min is much deeper. The similarities suggest
that the MST statistics data vectors could be compressed into a few
values (this possibility will be investigated in future work). In any
case the similarities are not a cause for concern as the interdependencies of these parameters are taken into account in the Fisher matrix
calculation and would appear as covariances.
APPENDIX C: FISHER MATRIX CONSTRAINTS FROM
THE MST
Additional constraints from the MST and power spectrum multipoles
are presented in this section. In addition to the measurements made
in the paper at redshift 𝑧 = 0, we also make measurements at redshift
𝑧 = 0.5 and 𝑧 = 1, and finally combine the analysis over the three
redshifts.
In Tab. C1 we compare the constraints of the MST and power spectrum multipoles for the different neutrino mass derivative estimates
presented in this paper.

4, the least accurate estimator using 𝑀𝜈 = 0.2 and 0.4 eV, all the estimators in real and redshift space show tighter constraints for the MST than the power
spectrum. Furthermore, when they are combined the constraints appear to be dominated by the MST.

Table C2. Separate and combined constraints for parameters from the 𝜈ΛCDM model determined from measurements of the power spectrum (multipoles in

Eq. 5 and Eq. 6. The former is used for the analysis presented in this paper and for comparison with Massara et al. 2020 while the latter is provided to allow
comparisons with results obtained by Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2019, Hahn et al. 2019 and Uhlemann et al. 2019. For the standard ΛCDM parameters we
obtain competitive constraints from the MST at all redshifts, with the exception of Ωm and 𝜎8 where the power spectrum dominates; however for 𝑀𝜈 the MST
dominates. When measurements from the different redshifts are combined we find the MST is competitive for all parameters, including Ωm and 𝜎8, but still
dominates constraints on 𝑀𝜈.

Figure B3. Derivatives for the MST branch length 𝑏 are shown for the six 𝜈ΛCDM parameters (ℎ, 𝑛𝑠, Ωb, Ωm, 𝜎8, and 𝑀𝜈) in redshift space and an additional
nuisance parameter 𝑀min. Error bars are obtained using Eq. 7 and Eq. 9 for 𝑀𝜈. The sensitivity to each parameter can be assessed by the significance of
deviations away from 𝜕𝑁 (𝑏)/𝜕𝜃 = 0 (dotted black line). The derivatives are shown for three binning schemes (𝑁bins): 200 (blue), 100 (orange), and 40 (green).
