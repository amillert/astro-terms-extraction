PBH formation from spherically symmetric hydrodynamical perturbations: a review
Abstract: Primordial black holes, which could have been formed in the very early Universe due to the
collapse of large curvature fluctuations, are nowadays one of the most attractive and fascinating research
areas in cosmology for their possible theoretical and observational implications. This review article
presents the current results and developments on the conditions for primordial black hole formation from
the collapse of curvature fluctuations in spherical symmetry on a Friedman-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker
background and its numerical simulation. We review the appropriate formalism for the conditions of
primordial black hole formation, and we detail a numerical implementation. We then focus on different
results regarding the threshold and the black hole mass using different sets of curvature fluctuations.
Finally, we present the current state of analytical estimations for the primordial black hole formation
threshold, contrasted with numerical simulations.

1. Introduction
One of the great mysteries in Science is the composition of dark matter, which accounts for the 27%
of the present Universe. Although there are different theories and candidates that try to explain it, still
the answer remains elusive. One of the most promising possibilities is Primordial Black Holes (PBHs),
i.e. black holes (BH) generated at earlier than star formation times and therefore not of stellar origin. For
the current observational status and constraints of PBHs in the form of dark matter we refer the reader to
[1–6] .
PBHs were first considered in [7,8]. They could be formed in the very early Universe due to the
gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations. Under this scenario, PBHs could have been generated
as a consequence of high non-linear peaks in the primordial distribution of density perturbations, leaving
open the possibility that PBHs could constitute a significant fraction of the Dark Matter (DM) [9–31].
PBHs with a size smaller than MPBH < 10−20 M would have been already evaporated due to
Hawking radiation [32]. Therefore, those with higher masses can account for dark matter. In addition,
they may be responsible to seed supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies [33,34], to generate
large-scale structure through Poisson statistics [35] or change the thermal history of the Universe [36].
Although PBHs were theorized time ago, it has not been until now that their popularity has increased
exponentially. The current big interest in PBHs (and its golden age) is due to the first detection of
gravitational waves from a black hole merger by the LIGO/Virgo collaborations [37]. Soon after this
remarkable discovery, it was suggested that the constituents of the black hole merger could have had a
primordial origin [16,38]. Later on, several analyses on the data signals have suggested that the population
arXiv:2111.12693v1 [gr-qc] 24 Nov 2021
2 of 58
of black holes detected could have a primordial origin [24,39–43] (see also references therein). On the other
hand, recent results on the NANOGrav experiment [44] have also been connected with PBHs [23,45–52]
If formed by the collapse of inflationary perturbations, the abundance of PBHs is exponentially
sensitive to the threshold of the gravitational collapse δc [53] (where δc is the minimum amplitude of the
gravitational potential peak related to the perturbation undergoing to gravitational collapse and leading
to a BH). In order to obtain the necessary precision on δc, a numerical analysis of PBH formation is an
obvious way to go.
Numerical simulations of PBH formation started some time ago, the first one was done in [54], where
was studied the non-linear behavior of the gravitational collapse. Later on, in [55,56], δc was computed
and a scaling behaviour for the PBH mass was found whenever the amplitude of the perturbation was
close to δc [55–58]. The value of the scaling exponent found was consistent with the one given in the
literature and computed from a perturbative treatment[59,60], or from numerical simulations [61] in
asymptotically flat spacetime. While the constant of proportionality appearing in the scaling law depends
on the specific shape of the perturbation considered, the scaling exponent is a universal quantity only
dependent on the type of fluid. Earlier simulations on PBHs were mainly based on the application of
a Lagrangian hydrodynamic code based on finite differences and developed from an earlier work [62],
solving Misner-Sharp equations [63], which describe the motion of a relativistic fluid in a curved spacetime.
An inconvenience of this procedure is the appearance of a coordinate singularity after forming the apparent
horizon, which breaks down the simulation. To resolve that issue, Hernandez-Misner equations [64] (which
are the Misner-Sharp equations in null coordinates) are used to evade the formation of an apparent horizon
and follow the subsequent evolution to determine the value of the black hole mass. The method is based on
[65]. As was shown in [66], the formation of PBHs from the collapse of initial fluctuations at super-horizon
scales does not form shocks (a discontinuous solution) in comparison with the earlier result of [57], where
shock waves were found, but using initial conditions on sub-horizon scales.
On the other hand, even if a numerical code allows to compute the threshold, the realization of
a numerical simulation can be quite expensive to be actually useful for statistical applications such as
the calculations of PBH abundances. Therefore an analytical expression would drastically simplify the
problem. There are some analytical estimations of δc (e.g. [67] and [68]), which were based on analytical
models under certain assumptions. However, numerical simulations have shown that, even for a fixed
equation of state, δc is not universal [56,57,66,69–73]. The main argument is that δc is dependent on the
specific detail of the initial curvature fluctuation [72], i.e., on the scale dependence or “shape” of the
perturbation, something that these analytical estimations do not take into account.
Some works have tried to characterize the threshold for black hole formation in terms of the initial
density perturbation profile. In [74] was used the amplitude of the curvature fluctuation and its second
radial derivate at the centre to characterize the initial configuration profiles, showing that the probability
of PBH formation is sensitive to them. Later on, in [75], numerical simulations were used to argue that
the formation of a PBH from an over-density peak in a FLRW Universe assuming the perturbation to be
initially at super cosmological scales, it only depends upon two master parameters: the integral of the
initial curvature perturbation, and the edge of the over-density distribution. The paper in [72] recently
refined the arguments of [75] by showing that these parameters may be more conveniently given in terms
of the amplitude of the ”gravitational potential” at its maximum (r = rm), as already noticed in [70], and
that it mainly depends upon the functional form (shape) of the gravitational potential. More precisely,
in [72], the threshold δc was identified with the peak of the “compaction function” [70] at super-horizon
scales. The compaction function, closely resembles the Schwarzschild gravitational potential and is defined
as twice the local excess-mass over the co-moving areal radius.
Following the aim to have a more accurate analytical estimation for the threshold of PBH formation,
recently in [76] was argued that the threshold for primordial black hole formation should be quite
3 of 58
insensitive to the physics beyond rm: The threshold is the amplitude for which a "black hole" with zero
mass would be formed. Therefore, all the over-density beyond rm will be diffused away while that just in
the proximity of rm will block the collapse.
With those arguments, it was shown that during a radiation-dominated epoch (equation of state
p = wρ with w = 1/3), with a very good approximation, there exists a universal threshold value for the
volume-averaged compaction function, which is actually shape-independent. Taking into account that
the volume average is dominated by scales near the maximum of the compaction function, in [76] it was
shown that it is enough to parametrize the profile dependence of δc by the curvature-shape around the
compaction function at its maximum. Applying this result was made an analytical approximation for
δc taking into account the shape dependence on the curvature fluctuation, which matches that found in
simulations to within a few percent [76].
From the results in [76], there was the question of whether or not this universality on the averaged
critical compaction function is generic and not only an accident of radiation. Thus in [77], was addressed
the universality question beyond the case of a radiation fluid. In [77] was generalized the arguments of
[76] to provide a new analytical estimation for the threshold in terms of the equation of state and the
shape-profile. This analytical formula was tested in front of numerical simulations and was found an
accuracy better than a 6%.
The other half-part of the problem is the determination of the final PBH mass. When a perturbation
collapses, it will firstly form an apparent horizon with an associated mass MPBH,i
. After that, due to the
surrounding fluid of the FLRW background, there is an accretion process up to a final mass MPBH, f when
the PBH is formed. As we have indicated, for fluctuations whose amplitude is near the threshold (the
critical regime) was found a scaling law for the PBH mass in terms of the amplitude of the perturbation
[55–58]. Although the importance of this result was pointed out in the context of critical collapse [78],
nowadays it is substantially relevant because, as is indicated in the current literature [53], the PBHs with
higher probability of formation are those that are formed in the critical regime. The probability distribution
function is exponentially suppressed beyond the threshold, and therefore can be directly used the scaling
law for estimations of PBH abundances.
On the other hand, some studies have also considered the maximum size of PBHs at the formation
time and the accretion effect from the surrounding background in the final mass of the PBH MPBH, f
.
It was already noticed in [67,79] that the accretion effect for small PBH should be small. Specifically,
in[79] were derived some analytical expressions for the upper bound of a PBH formed by the collapse
of hydrodynamical perturbations. In [80] was computed numerically the MPBH, f
for different curvature
profiles and was quantified the accretion effect, which could be substantially large for PBHs formed
beyond the critical regime O(10%). There was also made a numerical comparison with some estimations
of [79] for the case of radiation fluid.
In conclusion, considering the recent developments of the field and future perspectives, we present
this review paper to give the current state-of-the-art regarding the analytical, numerical and theoretical
results about PBH formation from the collapse of hydrodynamical perturbations on a FLRW background
under spherical symmetry; currently, the most common and popular scenario in the literature [32]. We
hope that this review paper allows the scientific community to be introduced to the topic of PBH formation
and understand the main insights.
We want to tell the reader that there are fascinating and valuable review papers on the PBH topic
with a different perspective than the one considered here. For an interesting historical review of the dark
matter candidates, we refer the reader to [81]. About reviews that focus on gravitational waves applied to
PBHs and the different constraints to account for the dark matter we have [1,82–88]. Another interesting
review with potential applications to PBHs is [89], which is focused on scenarios with deviations from
radiation domination in the early Universe.

This review paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we present the basics of PBH formation. In
section 3 we give some basic details about the statistical estimation of PBH abundances. In section 4 we
give the necessary ingredients to set up the formalism of PBH formation, in particular: the differential
equations that describe the collapse of the perturbations, the initial conditions, the definition of compaction
function and the threshold criteria. In section 5 we discuss and comment on the different numerical
techniques employed in the literature, and we focus on a specific method publicly available. In section 6
we give numerical results regarding the threshold and PBH mass in terms of the specific profiles using
numerical simulations. In section 7 we discuss in detail the different developments for the analytical
estimation of the threshold. Finally, in section 8 we enumerate other scenarios of PBH formation not
explicitly considered in this review.
2. Basics on PBH formation
As we have pointed out in the previous section 1, PBHs could have been formed in the very early
Universe during radiation domination due to the gravitational collapse of large curvature perturbations
generated during inflation [7,8].
Under this scenario, the collapse or dispersion of those hydrodynamic perturbations depends on the
perturbation’s strength: if its greater than a given threshold, the perturbation will collapse and form a BH
after the perturbation crosses the cosmological horizon. Otherwise, if it is lower, it will disperse because
of pressure gradients preventing the collapse (a schematic picture can be found in Fig.1). Both things
could happen, i.e., the perturbation could undergo gravitational collapse and subsequently bounce. In this
case, the fluid is dispersed and collapsed continuously, making rarefactions waves (we will see it in more
detail in section 6). This behaviour is particularly evident when the initial strength of the perturbation is
very close to its threshold value. Therefore, pressure gradients play a crucial role in the collapse of the
perturbation. If pressure gradients are strong enough, they will prevent gravitational collapse, which
implies having a large threshold compared to the situation when the pressure gradients are small.
A big effort has been made during the past decades to find the correct PBH formation criteria. The
first estimation of a threshold was given by [7], using a Jeans-length argument and Newtonian gravity.
The criteria for the formation of a BH used was that the size of an over-density at the maximum expansion
should be larger than the Jeans length but also smaller than the particle horizon. This translates to the
requirement that the peak value of the density contrast at scales smaller than the cosmological horizon
must be at least w (where w is the equation of state of the perfect fluid which fills the FLRW Universe) in
order to collapse.
A simple, intuitive picture of PBH formation and its threshold connected with the Jeans length
argument can be found in [12], and we summarize it here. Consider a cosmological perturbation at
super-horizon scales. The spacetime metric can be written as a closed FLRW Universe (we will see in more
detail in section 4) with a radial dependence on K(r).

which basically corresponds to the FLRW equation but with a small non-homogeneity term given by K(r).

A region will collapse instead of expanding when K > 0 if we ignore the radial dependence on K(r).
This precisely happens when 3K/a
2 = 8πρ, which corresponds roughly when the Hubble scale becomes
equal to the lengthscale of the curved region. In this case, the assumption done with Eq.1 is no anymore
valid but still can be assumed to get some threshold estimation.
On that time (let’s called it t = tc), if we consider an homogeneous and isotropic Universe, this would
imply δρ(tc)/ρb = 1. In particular:

The criteria is that perturbations can not collapse if they have smaller scales than the Jeans length,

w is the sound speed of the fluid (perfect fluid

which is basically the threshold value estimation obtained in [7].
The second analytical estimation came years later in [68]. The authors considered a compensated
"three zone" model, i.e, a central over-dense region followed by an under dense layer (which compensates
the over density) and finally the FLRW background, to estimate the threshold for BH formation. Following
an argument about the sound waves at the maximum expansion of the perturbation, it was found that the
threshold of the peak value of the overdensity when it renters the horizon must be (3(1 + w)/(5 + 3w)) ·
sin2
(π
√
w/(1 + 3w)).
Later on, however, became clear that the threshold depends on the shape of the curvature perturbation
[56,58,75]. Moreover, it also depends on the specific equation of state of the fluid, since pressure gradients
plays a role on the determination of it: larger is w stronger are the pressure gradients and therefore higher
is the threshold.
In [70] a new criteria for PBH formation was introduced. Importantly, it was found that the peak
of the compaction function (the average mass excess on a given volume) was a good criterion for PBH
formation and currently have become the standard definition of threshold, that we call δc. Previously to
this criteria, some other measures for the threshold "definition" were not empty of some issues. See [72] for
a historical perspective about that.
In [72] simulations were performed for a radiation fluid with a set of curvatures profiles leading to a
range of threshold values given by 0.41 . δc ≤ 2/3 using the criteria of the compaction function’s peak as
the threshold definition. Later on, in [76] the minimum threshold value was refined, getting 0.4 rather
than 0.41 in the case of a radiation fluid. This difference was due to a choice of unphysical profiles in some
extreme limit of the range parameter.
Although δc is a profile dependent quantity, in [76,77] was shown that exist an (approximately)
universal value given by the averaged critical compaction function, which allowed to build a sufficiently
accurate analytical expression for δc, which only depends on the type of fluid and the curvature around
the peak of the compaction function.
On the other hand, if a perturbation is sufficiently strong, it will collapse and form an apparent horizon.
Later on, will follow a process of accretion of energy density from the surrounded FLRW background until

reaching a stationary state, when the final mass of the PBH is achieved. As was shown in [55,56], the final
PBH mass follows a critical scaling law when the amplitude of the perturbation is close to its threshold
value (the critical regime),
MBH = KMH(δ − δc)
γ
, (6)
with values of γ consistent with previous numerical computation [78,90] γ ≈ 0.356. The scaling
exponent is universal and only depends on the type of fluid, not on the initial condition. The MH is the
mass of the cosmological horizon at the time of horizon crossing (when the lengthscale of the perturbations
equals the cosmological horizon). The constant K depends on each initial condition used. As in the case of
the threshold, the values of K are different depending on what initial conditions, but with values O(1)
[91].
The simulations in [56] were done for δ − δc & 10−5 which was not sufficient to test the critical
regime up to very small values, i.e, up to machine precision δ − δc ≈ 10−15. In [66] it was verified, finally,
the scaling law up to machine precision, and this was tested with an explicit example of a gaussian
perturbation.
3. The abundance of PBHs
This section will give a brief review of the two approaches commonly used in the literature to perform
PBH statistics (formed in radiation-dominated Universe) and estimate their abundances. In this review,
we do not focus on the statistical estimation of PBH abundances, for which there are extensive works in
this direction, with different approaches and methods. If the reader is interested, we suggest to check these
references and the ones therein [92–112]. But to show this topic at the basic level, we will basically describe
the Press-Schechter [113] and the peak theory [114] procedures. This section aims to clearly point out the
relation between the threshold and PBH mass on the estimation of PBH abundances, especially why the
threshold should be known with enough accuracy to be useful for statistics.
In both cases, we consider the amplitude of the peak of density contrast in the comoving slicing,
(usually denoted in the literature as ∆ ≡ δρ(0)/ρb
[53,115]), as a statistically distributed variable. The
power spectrum associated to the density contrast is defined as,

. (8)
In the Press-Schechter formalism we make two assumptions: i) the density contrast field ∆ is a
Gaussian variable ii) perturbations with ∆ > ∆c will collapse and form a PBH. So basically we integrate
the probability distribution P(∆) over the range ∆c ≤ ∆ < ∆max, where ∆max is the maximum allowed
value. In practice, we integrate up to ∆max → ∞ since the probability distribution is a rapidly decreasing
function above ∆c, and therefore does not change the result and allows to simplify the computation. It’s
important to notice that ∆c 6= δc, since we are comparing the critical density contrast with the critical
averaged density contrast.

. Where has been assumed that the scaling
law is accurate always even when ∆  ∆c (something not true, as we will show in section 6), but since the
probability distribution is exponentially smaller for large ∆, Eq.10 is accurate. In the case of considering a
monochromatic mass spectrum, i.e., that all the PBHs formed to have the same mass (in particular to the
horizon mass MH), the abundance is given by,
β = K¯ erf 

(11)
This can be obtained by simply taking the limit γ → 0 and K = K¯ in Eq.10.
The procedure in the peak theory approach is a bit different. It makes statistics on counting the
numbers of over-threshold peaks on the over-density, another approach used the curvature fluctuation ζ
peaks instead [99,116].
We summarize the procedure done in [53] to estimate the abundances through peak theory.
First of all, we define the variable ν = ∆/σ0, which in the rare peak assumption we have that ν  1.
The number of rare peaks is given by [114],

where a is the scale factor and tf

only that peaks higher than the threshold value νc will contribute to the formation of PBHs. Therefore,

where k∗ = σ1/(

for PBH formation and the linear dependence on the constant K associated to the scaling law. This is
the reason why an accurate determination of the threshold is essential, since the abundances depends
exponentially on it. These two methods are however only an approximation of the true statistics which
consider the fact that each statistical realization of profiles have different threshold. This was developed in
[92], we will not discuss it here as it is beyond the scope of this review paper. However, as it can be seen in
[92] one finds again the generic behavior that β is exponentially sensitive to the threshold.
4. Cosmological set up for PBH formation
This section reviews the needed ingredients to simulate the formation of PBHs on a FLRW Universe
under spherical symmetry and filled by a perfect fluid. We will see what differential equations describe
the gravitational collapse, the consistent initial conditions for PBH formation we need to use, and the
boundaries condition to supply. Later on, we will study the formation of the apparent horizon and
characterize it in terms of the expansion of the congruences. Finally, we will describe the process of
accretion of the PBH mass from the FLRW background and how it can be estimated its final mass.
4.1. Misner-Sharp equations
The Misner-Sharp equations [63] describe the motion of a relativistic fluid with spherical symmetric .
It corresponds to the Einstein field Equations written in the comoving gauge (the gauge we use in this
review paper). To obtain them, first of all, we need to consider a perfect fluid with energy-momentum
tensor,

µ are given by u
t = 1/A and u
i = 0 for i = r, θ, φ,

since we are considering comoving coordinates (comoving gauge). In all the review paper, we will use
units GN = c = 1.
Solving the Einstein field equations for this problem, appear the following quantities:

B(r, t)
∂R(r, t)

where Dt and Dr are the proper time and distances derivatives, respectively. U is the radial component of
the four-velocity associated with an Eulerian frame (so not comoving), which measures the radial velocity
of the fluid with respect to the origin of coordinates. The Misner-Sharp mass M(r, t) is introduced as:

We refer to the reader to check [63] to see the details of the derivation. The boundary conditions in the
Misner-Sharp equation are R(r = 0, t) = 0, leading to U(r = 0, t) = 0 and M(r = 0, t) = 0. Then, by
spherical symmetry, we have Dr p(r = 0, t) = 0 and also we consider a perfect fluid p = wρ.
At r → ∞, we should recover the solution of the FLRW background. However, in a numerical
simulation, we have to handle the discretization of time and space. Therefore, is used the condition
Dr p(r = rf
, t) = 0 (where rf
if the outer point of the grid) to match with the FLRW solution and avoid
reflections from density waves. On the other hand, Eq.25 is called the Hamiltonian constraint, which is
commonly used to check the correct solution of the numerical equations. For the case p = wρ, the lapse
equation in Eq.26 can be solved considering A(rf

4.2. The gradient expansion approximation, initial conditions and compaction function
The gradient expansion method [118] (also called long-wavelength approximation) was used in [119]
to set up consistent initial conditions for PBH formation on a FLRW background at super-horizon scales.
First of all, let’s consider a cosmological perturbation at super-horizon scales, i.e. with a length-scale Rm
much larger than the Hubble horizon. We can define a parameter e to relate the two scales: the Hubble
horizon RH and the length-scale of the perturbation Rm,
e =
RH(t)
Rm(t)
, (33)
where RH = 1/H. It is clear that at super-horizon scales we will have e  1. The gradient expansion
method allows to expand these inhomogeneities in the spatial gradient in terms of e. In the limit e → 0, the
spacetime locally corresponds to the FLRW metric, when the perturbation is smoothed out at sufficiently
large scales Rm.
Consider a general spacetime metric in the 3 + 1 Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism [120,121],
ds2 = −α
2
dt2 + γij(dxi + β
i
dt)(dxj + β
j
dt), (34)
in general, the spatial part of the metric can be decomposed in
γij = a
2
(t)e
2ζ(t,x
i
)γ˜ij (35)
where γij, βi and α are the spatial metric, shift-vector and lapse function respectively. The ζ is usually
called the curvature fluctuation. Under the gradient expansion method, was shown in [70,122–124] that
β = O(e), α = 1 + O(e
2
) and γ˜ij = δij + O(e
2
). Therefore in spherical symmetry and in the limit e → 0,
the metric of Eq.34 can be written as,
ds2 = −dt2 + a
2
(t)e
2ζ(r˜)
(dr˜
2 + r˜
2
dΩ2
). (36)
Notice the time independence of ζ(r˜) since at super-horizon scales it is shown that ˙ζ = O(e
2
). Is important
to point out, that although we consider the comoving gauge, other gauges are possible. In particular, in
[70] was used the constant mean curvature gauge instead. But as was shown in [69,123], the differences
between the two gauges in the ζ are of O(e
2
).

Finally, the metric Eq.36 can be also written in other coordinates as a FLRW metric with a non-constant
curvature K(r),

The change of coordinates r,r˜ between the two metrics and the conversion between K(r), ζ(r˜) are given
by the following relations, which have been obtained in several works previously (not necessarily in the
context of PBH formation all of them) [72,74,108,125]:

Therefore, the cosmological perturbation will be characterized by the curvature perturbation K(r), ζ(r˜).

The area radius of the length-scale Rm is given by Rm(t) = a(t)rm or also Rm(t) = a(t)r˜me
ζ(r˜m) with
the r˜ coordinate taking into account Eq.38. As was shown in [126], where was applied the gradient
expansion method beyond first order using an iterative scheme (see [126] for more terms in the e expansion
in comparison with Eq.39), the long-wavelength approximation at first order is accurate enough if a
sufficiently small e parameter is taken.
When we take e = 0 we recover the background solution equations: H(t) = H0t0/t , a(t) = a0(t/t0)
α
and RH(t) = RH(t0)(t/t0) where a0 = a(t0) , H0 = H(t0) = α/t0 and RH(t0) = 1/H0. Moreover we
define α = 2/3(1 + w). We also consider as initial condition that rm = ΛRH(t0), where Λ is some number
(the same with r˜m). Is commonly defined in the literature a time scale given when e(tm) = 1, which
precisely correspond to the time when the Hubble horizon equals the lengthscale of the perturbation (the
time of horizon crossing) tm = t0(a0rm/RH(t0))1/(1−α)
.
On the other hand, the amplitude of a cosmological perturbation can be measured as the averaged
density contrast within a spherical region:
¯δ(R) = 1

where δρ = ρ − ρb and V = 4πR

Related to that, in [70] was defined the compaction function C(r), which gives a measure of the mass
excess on a given volume. In particular,
C(r, t) = 2 [M(r, t) − Mb
(r, t)]
R(r, t)
, (43)
where Mb
(r, t) is the mass of the FLRW background in the volume V. The compaction function can also be
written in terms of ¯δ as was shown in [69],
C(R) = ¯δ(RH)
2
. (44)
At leading order in e,
¯δ(r, t) = 

where
δ(r) = f(w)K(r)r
2

f(w) = 3(1 + w)/(5 + 3w). (47)
13 of 58
From the above definitions, we finally define the compaction function at super-horizon scales at leading
order of gradient expansion as:
C(r, t) ' C(r) = f(w)K(r)r
2 =
r
2
r
2
m
δ(r), (48)
which yields C(rm) = δ(rm) = δm, i.e., δm = f(w)K(rm)r
2
m . The compaction function at super-horizon
scales is an essential magnitude, since allows to use it to define the threshold itself. In particular, we now
define the location of the maximum of C(r) as rm, and its value Cmax = C(rm) is going to be used as a
criteria for PBH formation as was proposed in [70], and rm (r˜m in the case of using the r˜ coordinate) is
considered the lenghtscale of the perturbation. The threshold for PBH formation will correspond to the
peak value of the critical compaction function, i.e, Cc(rm) = δc. Therefore, we define the "amplitude" of
the perturbation as δm = C(rm). Perturbations with δm > δc will collapse and form a PBH. In the opposite
case, perturbations with δm < δc, will disperse on the FLRW background with no black hole formation.
Notice that from Eq.37 we have a bound on the amplitude value δm at super-horizon scales given by
δm,max = f(w), since Kmax(rm)r
2
m = 1.
Because of the previous definitions, the value of rm is given by the solution of C
0
(r) = 0:
K(rm) + rm
2
K

(rm) = 0. (49)
The definition of the compaction function at super-horizon scales using the ζ(r˜) perturbation instead
of K(r) leads to a different sightly definition,
C(r˜) = f(w)

which yields the following condition for the peak r˜m:

and therefore δm = −f(w)[2 + r˜mζ

(r˜m). Interestingly, in [72] it was found ¯δ(rm, t) =
3δρ(rm, t)/ρb at super-horizon scales, which relate the averaged mass excess with the local density contrast
at rm.
In this review paper, we are going to focus on PBH type I, which are those that fulfill that the areal
radius R is a monotonic function, i.e, R
0 > 0. Instead PBHs type II satisfy R
0 < 0 [127]. PBHs type II
are still unexplored in the literature from a numerical point of view or even with a general analytical
treatment.
4.3. Horizon formation
If an initial perturbation at super-horizon scales has an amplitude δm bigger than its threshold δc, the
perturbation will continue growing and, at some point, will be formed a trapped surface. It indicates the
onset of gravitational collapse.
To identify when trapped surfaces are formed, we have to consider the expansion Θ± of null geodesics
congruences k
±, orthogonal to a spherical surface Σ. The expansion Θ± is defined as Θ± ≡ h
µν∇µk
±
ν
,
where h
µν is the spacetime metric induced on Σ. There are two congruences, we call them inwards k
+
µ and
outwards k
−
µ whose components are k

µ = (A, ±B, 0, 0) with k
+ · k
− = −2
14 of 58
In the case of flat spacetime, Θ− < 0 and Θ+ > 0, and these surfaces Σ are called normal surfaces.
On the other hand, if Θ± < 0 the surface is called trapped, while if both are positive Θ± > 0 the surface is
anti-trapped. In our case, we have that,
Θ
± =
2
R
(U ± Γ). (52)
In spherical symmetry, we can consider that any point (r, t) is a closed surface Σ with a proper radius
R. These points can be classified as normal, trapped and anti-trapped. Specifically, the transition from
a normal to a trapped surface should satisfy Θ− < 0 and Θ+ = 0, which corresponds to a marginally
trapped surface, usually called the "apparent horizon". Taking into account that Θ+Θ− = 4
R2
(U2 − Γ
2
),
the condition for the apparent horizon is given by U2 = Γ
2 ⇒ 2M = R.
In Figure.2 can be seen the evolution of 2M(r, t)/R(r, t) and the congruences Θ± in time for a
supercritical (with an amplitude δm > δc) Gaussian curvature fluctuation, after the first horizon has been
formed. The same qualitative behaviour can be applied for any perturbation of PBH type I (with w 6= 0).
Figure 2. Top panel: Profile of 2M/R once the trapped surface has been formed. The dashed line
corresponds to 2M/R = 1. Bottom panel: Profiles of the two expansions Θ± at the same time t than
the top panel. The vertical orange lines corresponds to points where Θ± = 0. The initial fluctuation
considered corresponds to a Gaussian profile.
Looking the Fig.2 we can see three points where 2M = R, and therefore three different surfaces that
we can characterize:
• Surface (A-B) In this region we have a transition between Θ+ > 0 and Θ− < 0 (normal region) to
Θ+ < 0 and Θ− < 0. This horizon, moves inwards the computational domain, which eventually
will encounter a singularity at r = 0.
• Surface (B-C) In this region we have a transition between Θ+ < 0 and Θ− < 0 to Θ+ > 0 and
Θ− < 0 (normal region). This horizon, typically called "the apparent horizon", moves outwards the
computational domain. Actually, this horizon and the previous one emerge from a single marginally
trapped surface. During the evolution can be followed the motion of the horizon to obtain the
PBH mass M(r∗, t), where r∗(t) is the location of the outer horizon in time. At the final stage of the
gravitational collapse for very late times, this horizon will become static, i.e, r∗ = const.
• Surface (C-D) In the last region we have transition between Θ+ > 0 and Θ− < 0 (normal region) to
Θ+ > 0 and Θ− > 0. This case corresponds to an anti-trapped surface, which corresponds to the
15 of 58
cosmological horizon, moving outwards. We should mention that this horizon does not correspond
to the cosmological horizon RH from the FLRW background, since the perturbed medium (deviated
from the FLRW solution) affects the evolution of the cosmological horizon.
For a more formal discussion about horizons, we suggest the reader to check [128–137].
4.4. PBH mass and accretion
Once the apparent horizon is formed, the initial PBH mass, i.e., the mass of the PBH MPBH,i at the
moment of formation of the first apparent horizon tAH, will start to grow up to arrive at a stationary value
MPBH,f. This situation is different from the case of dust collapse w = 0, where the mass would increase
forever since no pressure gradients would avoid the accretion of energy matter.
The process of accretion of energy-matter from the FLRW background has been studied in the past
[7,79,138,139] in different scenarios. To estimate the final mass of the PBH, one could follow the motion
of the apparent horizon until very late times when the horizon remains static. But since it could be
computationally very expensive, we can use the Zeldovich-Novikov formula Eq.53 [139], which consider
Bondi accretion [139–141], and in our case, assume that the energy density right outside the apparent
horizon decreases as in an FLRW Universe. It is essential to indicate that this is not valid at the time tAH,
since it neglects the cosmological expansion of the spacetime [142], but we can apply from sufficiently late
time for t  tAH considering an effective constant accretion efficiency rate F [140,141]. This approximation
was already used numerically in the context of PBH formation from domain walls in [143] with great
success.
In particular, for very late times t  tAH the mass accretion follows,
dM
dt = 4πFR2
PBHρb
(t) , (53)
where F is commonly numerically found to be of order O(1). Taking into account the condition of
apparent horizon in spherical symmetry RPBH = 2MPBH, the previous equation is solved analytically as:
MPBH(t) = 1

Ma
+ 3
2
F

1
t − 1
ta
 , (54)
where Ma is the initial mass when the asymptotic approximation is used at the time ta. The value of F has
been found to weakly depend on the specific shape of the perturbation and its amplitude but strongly
on the equation of state w. Specifically, F depends on the high non-linear process of accretion and the
counterpart of pressure gradients. F can be obtained numerically by fitting the evolution of MPBH(t) (at
sufficiently late times after the formation of the apparent horizon, when it is valid). Using that, the PBH
mass is estimated as the asymptotic mass value at t → ∞, i.e.
MPBH,f = MPBH(t → ∞) = 
1
Ma
−
3F
2ta
−1
. (55)
The final PBH mass will be dependent on the specific profile of the fluctuation, its initial amplitude
δm and w. As was already shown in the past, in the critical regime where δm is very close to the critical
value δc, then the black hole mass follows a scaling law [56–58],
MPBH,f = KMH(δm − δc)
γ
, (56)
16 of 58
where γ ≈ 0.356 in radiation w = 1/3. The values of γ in terms of the equation of state w were found
semi-analytically in [60] and are plotted in Fig.3. These results were numerically confirmed in [91].
Figure 3. Values of γ(w) plotted from the data of Table.1 in [60].
In Eq.56 the constant K depends on the specific shape of the profile considered and MH ≡ 1/2H(tm)
is the Hubble mass, which is calculated at the time tm. Specifically, MH in terms of the initial values of
perturbation can be written as:
MH =
3(1 + w)
4
t0 (a0Λ)
3(1+w)
1+3w , (57)
which will depend on the initial lenghtscale rm and the equation of state w (we can consider gauge
values a0 = 1 and t0 = 1). In the case of using the r˜ coordinate is just needed to replace Λ → Λe
ζ(ΛRH(t0))
in Eq.57. The scaling law starts to deviate at (δm − δc) & 2 · 10−2
(for w = 1/3) as was indicated in
[91]. It was shown explicitly in [73] that for large δm beyond the critical case, the scaling law seems to
be deviated by order of O(10%) (at least for w = 1/3), but it can be smaller or larger depending on the
profile considered. The deviation from the critical regime is expected to be also found for other w’s, but
the quantification still is missing in the literature. As pointed out in [144], it is important to consider the
scaling law behavior Eq.56 for the predictions of the PBH mass spectra.
5. Numerical techniques
Most of the times, PDEs can not be solved analytically, and numerical methods are needed. This is
especially common in general relativity and is the case we have here. Nowadays several methods and
tools can be employed in numerical relativity [145–153]. In the case of PBH formation, there is the extra
difficulty that the gravitational collapse happens on a FLRW background, so not on asymptotically flat
spacetime.
Different authors have employed different numerical procedures to simulate PBH formation from
the collapse of curvature fluctuations under spherical symmetry, as we have mentioned in section
1. From a historical perspective, several works have used a finite differences approach to solve
Hernandez-Misner-Sharp equations in the comoving gauge [55,56,58,71,72,75,91,119,154]. Alternatively,
were also done simulations at earlier times using a different gauge, in particular, the mean curvature
gauge [70]. The numerical results of both procedures with different gauges were verified to be consistent
between them in [69]. A new numerical method came up recently using Pseudospectral methods [73] to
solve Misner-Sharp equations together with the use of an excision technique to get the final mass of the
black hole.
17 of 58
In this review, we are going to describe the pseudospectral collocation technique used in [73]. The
basics of the numerical code are available here [155] (currently the only one in the literature publicly
available), and therefore the reader can reproduce or even extent some of the results presented in this
review.
5.1. Pseudospectral methods
Pseudospectral methods have been extensively used in computer science for solving complex physics
phenomena [156–158]. The application to the field of numerical relativity has been also very popular to
study different problems, from astrophysics to more oriented on high energy physics [159–174].
In what follows, we outline how to use the basics of the pseudo-spectral technique applied to our
problem, which allows solving partially algebraically the differential equations describing the gravitational
collapse. See also [175,176] for much more details and mathematical foundations. In particular, we use the
Chebyshev collocation method (but there are also other formulations).
Let’s consider a function f(x) and fit it with Ncheb Chebyshev polynomials (any other orthonormal
function could be used too). The function f(x) can be composed by a sum of Chebyshev polynomials as,
fNcheb (x) =
Ncheb
∑
k=0
ckTk
(x), (58)
where Tk
(x) are the Chebyshev polynomial of order k. The coefficients ck with k = 0, 1, ..., Ncheb are
then obtained by solving fNcheb (xk
) = f(xk
) where xk = cos(kπ/Ncheb). The points xk
, which satisfies
T
0
k
(xk
) = 0, are called Chebyshev collocation points.
Therefore,
fNcheb (x) =
Ncheb
∑
k=0

c¯kN2
cheb(x − xk
)
, (60)
where c¯k = 2 if k = 0, N and c¯k = 1 in other cases. The functions Lk are the Lagrange interpolation
polynomials.
The derivate of p order of the function will be given by,
f
(p)
Ncheb
(xi) =
Ncheb
∑
k=0
L
(p)
k
(xi)fNcheb (xk
). (61)
We define the Chebyshev differentiation matrix as D(p) = {L
(p)
k
(xi)}. The components of the matrix are
given by:
D
(1)
i,j =
c¯i
c¯j

. (64)

To improve round-off errors in the numerical computations [176], is used the following identity of the
diagonal components of the matrix D:
D
(1)
i,i = −
Ncheb
∑
j=0,j6=i
D
(1)
i,j
. (65)
In spectral methods, the error decays exponentially with Ncheb. It represents a significant improvement
in comparison with finite differences, where the error decays algebraically like 1/Nv
, where v > 0 and N
is the number of points of the grid. The exponential convergence in spectral methods is obtained thanks to
the fact that the derivate at a given point is computed taking into account all the other points of the grid,
instead of finite differences that only consider the neighbours.
The radial domain Ω in our case corresponds to Ω = [rmin,rmax] where rmax = NHRH(t0) and
rmin = 0. NH is the number of initial cosmological horizons where we put the final point of the grid, which
usually is enough to take NH ∼ 102
. The domain of the Chebyshev polynomials is [−1, 1], therefore we
need to do a mapping between the physical domain and the spectral one. Different options are possible,
but commonly is used a linear mapping:
x˜k =
rmax + rmin
2
+
rmax − rmin
2
xk
. (66)
x˜k are the new Chebyshev points rescaled to our physical domain Ω. Also, the Chebyshev matrix can be
rescaled using the chain rule:
D˜ =
2
rmax − rmin
D. (67)
The imposition of boundary conditions in spectral methods is straightforward. In the case of Dirichlet
boundary condition at xk
, such that f(x = xk
) = uD,bc, we just need to satisfy fNcheb (x = xk
) = uD,bc.
In the case of Neumann boundary condition such that f
(1)
(x = xk
) = uN,bc, we should satisfy that
(D · fNcheb )(x = xk
) = uN,bc. The numerical stability will depend on the values chosen for dt and Ncheb. We
don’t have a completely "freedom" to choose those values. If the number of points of the grid is increased,
it will require a reduction on the time step dt, in order to avoid instabilities during the evolution. The
Courant-Friedrichs-Lax (CFL) condition for hyperbolic PDEs already indicates that the maximum allowed
time-step should fulfill dt ∝ 1/N2
.
There are situations where pressure gradients are substantially large during the numerical evolution.
This, for instance, can happen when the curvature fluctuation has very sharp profiles or when w becomes
large. In this situation is needed to increase the numerical accuracy of the simulation. One possibility is to
increase the number of points of the grid Ncheb, but of course, this would imply reducing the time step dt to
ensure stability. The other one (which is actually better and more clever) is to use a composite Chebyshev
grid: split the full domain into several Chebyshev grids depending on the density of points needed in
specific regions of the domain. In particular, the full domain Ω is split in M subdomains as Ωl = [rl
,rl+1
]
with l = 0, 1..., M. A mapping between the spectral and physical domain for each is required. We choose a
linear mapping again as,
x˜k,l =
rl+1 + rl
2
+
rl+1 − rl
2
xk,l
, (68)
where x˜k,l are the new Chebyshev points re-scaled to the subdomain Ωl
. The Chebyshev differentiation
matrix is re-scaled again using the chain rule:
D˜
l =
2
rl+1 − rl
Dl
. (69)
19 of 58
The numerical evolution is done independently in each subdomain, i.e., the spatial derivative is computed
using the Chebyshev differentiation matrix D˜
l associated with each subdomain, and the time integration
is done applying the Runge-Kutta 4 method on each subdomain.
To evolve across the different subdomains Ωl
, is needed to impose boundary conditions. The approach
followed is the one of [177], which is based on making an analysis of the characteristics of the field variables.
The prescription is that the incoming fields derivative is replaced by the time derivative of the outgoing
fields from the neighbouring domain at the boundaries. It was checked in [77] that all the fields of the
Misner-Sharp equations are incoming except for the density field. Therefore, the boundary conditions that
must be applied between each subdomain are:
M˙ (t,rl+1,i
) = M˙ (t,rl, f
), (70)
U˙ (t,rl+1,i
) = U˙ (t,rl, f
),
R˙(t,rl+1,i
) = R˙(t,rl, f
),
ρ˙(t,rl, f
) = ρ˙(t,rl+1,i
).
Where rl, f and rl+1,i means the last grid point in the subdomain Ωl and the first grid point in the subdomain
Ωl+1
respectively. A diagram of the imposition of the boundary conditions between the subdomains can
be found in Fig.4.

Through an analysis of characteristics, can be identified the flow of the field variables u and v, and apply
the prescription of Eq.70.
The use of multigrids in spectral methods has a similar idea to the use of an adaptative mesh
refinement (AMR) in finite differences, to increase the resolution of the grid in some regions. Actually,
the use of AMR was essential in [91] to verify the scaling law behaviour for the PBH mass in the critical
regime.
A known weak point of spectral methods is when they have to handle discontinuous solutions,
particularly with the presence of shocks, since the derivative at each point is computed globally, and
therefore, the discontinuity is quickly propagated to the other parts of the grids. In this situation, it is
better to use a finite differences approach, although usually is still needed a modification on the numerical
implementation to be able to capture shocks, like the introduction of artificial viscosity.
However, as has been mentioned in section 1, in our case, shocks are not formed in the simulations
since we should consider initial conditions at super-horizon scales [91].

5.2. Numerical procedure
In all the simulation we fix the value of w, t0 = 1 and a0 = 1. From that we automatically get H0 = α,
RH(t0) = 1/H0 and recall that α = 2/3(1 + w). For the initial lengthscale of the perpetuation is usually
considered rm = 10RH(t0) (Λ = 10), which is sufficient to ensure the long wavelength approximation as
was indicated in [72].
First, we are going to focus on describing the procedure to obtain the threshold δc, and we leave
the method to get the final mass MPBH,f for the following subsection. To obtain the threshold is used a
bisection method, which compares different regimes of δm until finding the range in which appears the
formation of the apparent horizon. The threshold δc corresponds to the midpoint of this range.
An example of a successful procedure is the following:
• Create the different grid points x˜k,l
for the different subdomains Ωl with a given number of points
Ncheb,l, and compute the different Chebyshev differentiation matrices Dl
. Introduce also the initial
time step dt0, which usually dt0 ≤ 10−3
is enough to ensure stability.
• Specify a lower and an upper limit in δm of the bisection. Can be chosen the maximum value
δmax = f(w) for the upper limit, and for the lower bound δmin ≈ w (which correspond to the
threshold estimation using a Jeans length criteria). To reduce the computational time can be chosen a
closer domain to the δc if such domain is known.
• A value δm is taken once the bisection starts. From that, can be build the curvature profiles K(r)
or ζ(r˜) and find the location of the compaction function peak rm, r˜m using Eqs.49, 51 respectively.
Subsequently, compute the perturbations of the hydrodynamical variables following Eqs.39,40.
• Integrate the Eqs.28, 31 at each time-step dt using the four-order Runge-Kutta method, imposing at
each internal time-step the boundary conditions at r = 0 and r = rf
. Including the internal boundary
conditions between the different Chebyshev grids Eq.70.
• To distinguish numerically the formation of an apparent horizon or not, we use the peak value of the
compaction function in time. When the peak approaches Cmax ≈ 1, it implies the formation of the
apparent horizon 3
. In this case, the value of δm chosen would imply the formation of a black hole, i.e.
δm,yes, and therefore a lower value δm closer to δc must be found modifying the bound of the bisection
in such way that δc ∈ [δc,min, δm,yes]. In the opposite case, when Cmax decreases continuously for
some time, this will imply the dispersion of the perturbation and the bisection bound should be
modified as δc ∈ [δm,no, δc,max].
• The previous steps are iterated until the difference between δm,yes and δm,no is lower than the
desired resolution, i.e., δm,yes − δm,no . δ(δc). From that, the threshold value is defined as δc =
(δm,yes + δm,no)/2 ± δ(δc). When δm approaches the critical value, in some cases the grid resolution
initially set up is not enough to follow the evolution, if so then δm is shifted according to δ(δc) to
avoid being close to δc. Another alternative would be the dynamical inclusion of more subgrids in
the desired region where gradients start to be large.
During the time evolution is used a conformal time step dt = dt0(t/t0)
α
, which improves substantially
the performance of the simulation. The 2-norm of the Hamiltonian constraint equation Eq.25 is computed
3 Technically, the condition of formation of the apparent horizon is given when 2M(r, t)/R(r, t) = 1. But for computationally
efficiency, is easier to check whatever C ≈ 1, since C = 2M(r, t)/R(r, t) − 2Mb(r, t)/R(r, t), which avoids to find the cosmological
horizon.

at each time step. It is expected that the constraint should remain constant from t = t0 if Einstein equations

5.3. Numerical estimation of the final PBH mass
To obtain the final mass of the PBH MPBH,f we use an excision technique, and we describe it with
detail in this section. Saying that, other alternatives in the literature have used null coordinates with the
Hernandez-Misner equations [56,64,66] to get the final mass. We refer the reader to these references, but
the primary approach followed can be summarized as follows: i) The simulation is set up with some initial
data using the Misner-Sharp equations. ii) Starting the evolution, an outgoing null radial ray is sent from
the centre to the outer point of the grid, and the values of the field variables are stored once the ray crosses
each grid point. iii) The Misner-Hernandez equations are evolved using the initial conditions obtained in
the previous step, which are basically the values stored.
Let’s focus now on excision. The main idea of an excision technique is based on the fact that nothing
inside the event horizon can affect the physics outside. Therefore, the aim is to dynamically remove the
segment of the computational domain inside the apparent horizon, to avoid large gradients appearing and
breaking down the simulation.
There are different procedures to implement excision, but the one we have used here is the following:
We define two parameters, ∆r and dr (always we consider ∆r > dr), where ∆r is the distance separation
between the apparent horizon and the excision surface that we establish after each redefinition of the
excision surface, and dr is the maximum allowed displacement of the apparent horizon before we create
a new excision boundary. At each time step, we locate the position of the apparent horizon, taking into
account that 2M(r∗, t)/R(r∗, t) = 1, where r∗(t) is the location of the apparent horizon in time. Since
we handle a discretized grid, we use a cubic spline interpolation to find the correct value of r∗(t) (the
difference of taking a quadratic spline interpolation is O(0.01%) for the PBH mass values).
In particular, the method used is the following:
For a supercritical perturbation, when the peak of the compaction function Cmax ≈ 1.2 (the final
result is not affected by the exact value that we take, as long as we consider Cmax ≈ O(1)), part of the
computation domain is removed, creating an excision surface close to the location of the apparent horizon,
whose separation from the excision boundary is basically given by ∆r. Once done this, we create a dense
but small Chebyshev grid starting from the excised boundary. Another single Chebyshev grid can cover
the other domain since large gradients are only developed near the excision surface.
We evolve in time the Chebyshev grids in the usual form independently, and we track the apparent
horizon motion at each dt. Once the apparent horizon has been moved a distance greater than dr, we create
a new excision surface separated a distance ∆r from the apparent horizon. During the evolution, we need
to continuously reduce the values ∆r,dr, since the velocity of the apparent horizon decreases in time. This
is especially important for very small δm − δc. We decide to reduce ∆r,dr when the Hamiltonian constraint
starts to be continually violated. In particular, it was found that considering ∆r ≈ 2dr ≈ O(10−2
) works
nicely for our purposes.
22 of 58
There is no physical boundary condition to apply at the excision surface. Still, it was found that to
freeze the gradient of ρ
0 at the excision surface, after each redefinition of the excision boundary, allows to
increase the stability of the method without changing the numerical results.
6. Numerical results
In this section, we are going to review some numerical results using the numerical procedure pointed
out in the previous section. First of all, we are going to introduce a set of curvature profiles that allows us
to span all different possible thresholds for PBH formation. Later on, we will see the dynamical evolution
of the collapse for three different cases in terms of the initial amplitude δm and with a specific profile
chosen. Finally, we will show the results regarding the final PBH mass in terms of the different profiles, as
well as the effect of the accretion from the FLRW background.
The numerical results have been obtained using the procedure of section 5 with a computer i − 7, 16
GB of RAM and without parallelization procedures. As an example of the efficiency, in the case of w = 1/3
and with a Gaussian profile, to obtain the threshold δc with a resolution δm − δc ≈ 10−3
the running time
was ∼ 3 − 5 minutes using the bisection method 5.2. To estimate the final mass MPBH,f was needed to
run the excision method 5.3 for ∼ 3 hours for the largest PBHs. These values can differ when changing
the profiles or equation of state w. The typical size of the grid chosen has been two or three grids with
∼ 100 points in each grid. However, it could be needed more points for sharp initial profiles. With these
configurations, the maximum resolution obtained for the threshold in the case of a Gaussian profile has
been δm − δc ≈ 10−5
(in the case of w = 1/3). With sharper profiles or larger w this resolution becomes
slightly reduced.
6.1. Curvature fluctuations
The seed of the generation of the curvature fluctuation is the power spectrum, namely P(k) where
k is the wavelength. We briefly review the procedure assuming Gaussian statistics of [114] applied to
our purposes. We consider that the amplitudes of the curvature perturbations are statistically Gaussian
distributed accordingly to the specific inflationary model considered. Therefore, since PBHs are rarely
formed, the over-densities leading to PBH formation are, with a very good approximation, spherically
symmetric [114].
From the power spectrum Pζ (k) we can relate it to the curvature fluctuation ζ Eq.36 as,

(79)
where µ is the peak value of ζ.
In conclusion, using Eq.79 we can relate the power spectrum to our curvature fluctuation ζ(r˜),
and from that set up the initial conditions following Eqs.40,41, or alternative also build K(r) using the
transformations of Eqs.38.
Although it goes beyond the scope of the review, we should mention that one could also consider the
effect of the inclusion of non-gaussianities in Eq.79. There are vast and extensive works that consider its
impact on the thresholds, and PBH abundances [100,105,106,178–191], including some of them that have
used numerical simulations following the basics shown in this review [192,193].
Saying that, it is much more practical to span already a set of curvature profiles instead of considering
different power spectrums when we are interested in studying the physical process of PBH formation.
The reason is that setting up directly the curvature fluctuation would allow to modulate different shapes
and therefore to get all possible thresholds and estimate their effects on the PBH mass. In any case, some
typical power spectrum templates can be found in [107,178].
In the literature has been commonly used exponential families of profiles to modulate K(r) [70,72,74,
75]. Another possibility is a polynomial family [77]. Both can be written in a convenient way as:
Kpol(r) = δm

(81)
The profiles of Eq.80 and Eq.81 corresponds to a polynomial and exponential (for λ = 0)-non centrally
peaked (for λ 6= 0) profiles respectively. Notice that the profiles depends on the ratio r/rm. The profiles
are written in a convenient way with the amplitude δm, in such away that when computing C(r) using
Eq.48, automatically gives C(rm) = δm when evaluating r = rm.
On the other hand, the parameter q is a dimensionless parameter which relates how is the shape
around the peak of the compaction function, which is defined as,
q = −

Interestingly, in [76] was found numerically that profiles with the same q have the same threshold δc upon
a deviation of O(3 − 4%) (and O(1 − 2%) in the particular case of a radiative dominated Universe), but we
will discuss this in more detail in section 7, since this result will be used to obtain analytical estimations on
δc.The benefit of Eq.80 in comparison with Eq.81 is that at r → 0 fulfills regularity conditions, something
that Eq.81 not for some small values of q. Actually, the profile Eq.80 can be considered as a basis profile,
since allows to span all possible thresholds values, as we will see in more detail in 6.3. The profiles of C(r)
for the polynomial profile can be found in Fig.5. When q  1 the peak of the compaction function is sharp,
while when q  1 the peaks is broad.

for the same profiles as the top panel. The profiles has been
normalized to the peak δρ(0)/ρb
. The negative peak value for q = 30 around r = rm goes up to ∼ −4.
A profile with two modulating peaks in C was also considered in [80]. It is similar to the one
considered in [71], where double PBH formation was studied.

Different profiles of the three families are plotted in Fig.6. In particular we have plotted the profiles
Eqs.80,81,84 and from them we have also plotted the corresponding compaction function from Eq.48, as
well as the density contrast Eq.40. The conversion from K(r) to ζ(r˜) can be made using Eq.38.

rj = 2rm1
, Ctt(peak,2) = 0.3, with the corresponding δ2 obtained from Eq.86 using the previous parameters,
q1 = 5 (violet) and q1 = 1 (orange).
6.2. Non-linear behavior of the gravitational collapse
In this subsection, we show the behaviour of the gravitational collapse of the curvature fluctuations for
three different regimes. As an example is considered a Gaussian profile given by Eq.81 with q = 1 (λ = 0)
and for different values of δm and w = 1/3. However, the same qualitative behaviour can be found for
other profiles and other w 6= 0. In particular, can be establish three different regimes: subcritical (δm < δc),
supercritical (δm > δc) with | δm − δc | O(10−3
) in both previous cases, and critical | δm − δc |6 O(10−3
).
In Figs. 7 (supercritical), 8 (subcritical) and 9 (critical) we see the evolution of the variables ρ, Γ, U and C.
26 of 58
In the case of a super-critical evolution, which is the case of Fig.7, we can observe that the compaction
function grows during the evolution. The gravitational collapse increases the energy density on the central
regions, and therefore the mass excess grows. It is also obvious the formation of the two horizons as
discussed in section 4.3. The outer horizon moves outwards, and the inner moves inwards, faster than the
outwards. The simulation breaks down when the inner horizon approaches r = 0. It is when the excision
technique has to be applied to remove the singularity.
In Fig. 8 (the sub-critical case) the compaction function decreases continuously as the perturbation is
diluted away due to the superiority of pressure gradients against gravity. In general, for late times, the
peak Cmax is pushed outwards due to the pressure gradients. This behaviour can also be seen with the
peak value of ρ/ρb
. In the supercritical case, the peak value is continuously increasing. In contrast, in the
subcritical case, the peak value starts to decrease at some moment (which means the perturbation start to
disperse). In addition, from the Figs. 7, 8 and 9 can be observed that Γ is not constant during the evolution.
As expected, the gradient expansion approximation fails for sufficiently late times t  t0.
In Fig. 7 (super-critical case) we observe that U/Γ decreases quickly in time, and a negative velocity
mainly dominates the profile before rm for late times, which indicates the collapse of the fluid. Instead, in
Fig. 8 (sub-critical case) only a small negative value U/Γ is reached for early times, and beyond that, the
values are positive, which indicates that the perturbation is dispersing, avoiding the gravitational collapse.
The most relevant behaviour is found in the critical regime, in Fig. 9. Here the fluid is divided into
two parts, one going outwards (positive U) and one inwards (negative U), which generates an under-dense
region. This under-dense region re-attract the fluid with a net effect of compression and rarefaction process,
which increases its velocity in time. In this situation, the gradients become very large and eventually break
down the simulation if a sufficient resolution has been not set up for the simulation.
It is interesting to mention that in the presence of secondary peaks in C(r) (not only one isolated),
with an amplitude roughly equal or less than the first one, it was verified numerically in [193] that those
secondary peaks decrease and disperses on the FLRW background, even in the case of supercritical
perturbations. A different situation could happen when a secondary peak is sufficiently high. In such
case, the secondary peak could also collapse even if the first peak is not greater than the threshold value to
collapse itself.

In Fig. 10 is shown the correctness of the numerical evolution using the Hamiltonian constraint of
Eq.72 at each step. It corresponds to different evolutions of the gravitational collapse, both subcritical
and supercritical. In the figure can be seen that the constraint starts to be violated for late times for
(δm − δc) ≈ O(10−5
), which gives a bound on the maximal resolution for δc (in this particular example)

The convergence with the use of spectral methods can be found in Fig.11. It is clear that the
convergence is exponential, which is a high improvement in comparison with the methods of finite
differences. In particular, the use of a multidomain grid improves the performance and accuracy of the
simulations substantially, as is shown in the right panel of Fig.11, where the spectral accuracy is obtained
with less number of points (in comparison with the left panel). Making the first grid Ω1 from r = 0 up to
r = 2rm, allows capturing the region where large gradients are developed. Then for the second grid Ω2
from r = 2rm up to r = rf and only needed few points.

δm = 0.5 and t = tH for w = 1/3.
An interesting behavior is found for tAH when w is changed, as noticed in [77]. Although pressure
gradients work against the gravitational collapse, since it is also a form of gravitational energy, it will
mostly favour it when the collapse is active. consequently it implies a shorter time of formation for larger
w, as can be observed in Fig.12.

chosen corresponds to Eq.80 with q = 1 and δm = δc + 10−2
.

6.3. Thresholds for PBH formation
As we have mentioned, the threshold for PBH formation depends on the shape of the curvature
fluctuation. Following the numerical procedure in section 5.2 can be obtained all the possible thresholds
for PBH formation using the basis polynomial profile of Eq.80. The results are shown in Fig.13 for different
profiles. In the particular case of a radiation fluid, has been found in [72,76] that the range of all possible
thresholds is δc ∈ [0.4, 2/3]. The minimum threshold δc,min = 0.4 corresponds to the limit case of q → 0
(broad profile in C, which would be a homogeneous sphere). Instead the maximum threshold δc,max = 2/3
corresponds to q → ∞ (peaked profile in C). Increasing q, larger are the pressure gradients, and therefore,
the threshold value is higher.
Remarkably, the relative deviation between the thresholds for the different profiles in Fig.13 with
the same q is within 2%. It was found for the first time in [76] and was shown that different profiles with
the same q (shape around the peak of the compaction function) have the same thresholds within a small
deviation.
Figure 13. Left panel: Threshold values δc in terms of q for the case of w = 1/3. Green points correspond to
Eq.80, red points to Eq.81 with λ = 0 and blue to Eq.81 with λ = 1. Right panel: Threshold values δc in
terms of q for different values of w corresponding to the polynomial profile of Eq.80.
In [77] were performed simulations of PBH formation in the case of a perfect fluid with w ∈ (0, 1]. The
functional behaviour of δc in terms of q for different w’s is roughly similar as is shown in the left panel of
Fig.13 (the case with fixed w = 1/3), but quantitatively the values are different. It is clear that increasing w,
the gradients will be larger and therefore, the threshold increases since pressure gradient will be stronger.
The limits q → 0 and q → ∞ limits for the general case in terms of w are both amenable to further analysis.
• The case q → 0 corresponds to a C that becomes approximately constant over a wide range of scales.
Simulations, in this case, becomes difficult due to the presence of conical singularities [77]. To solve
this issue, in [77] was used a modified profile of Eq.80 to subtract the mass excess beyond r  rm and
fulfil that at the boundaries the FLRW background is recovered. In Fig.14 is shown the numerical
values of δc(q → 0) in terms of w, which shows a strong dependence in w. As is expected, for w → 0
the threshold δc → 0.
• The case of large q → ∞ corresponds to the case of a sharply peaked for the compaction function.
For this kind of profiles, the pressure gradients acting against the gravitational collapse are maximal,
and hence the compaction function should be maximal too. Analytically it is shown from Eq.48 that
C(rm) < f(w) (at super-horizon scales). As was proved in [72] numerically, δc,max → f(w) in the
case of radiation w = 1/3. The intuition is that the saturation should persist to larger values of w
31 of 58
because larger values of w also imply larger pressures that fight against the collapse. Therefore, for
w ≥ 1/3, the compaction function of a peaked profile must also saturate the bound f(w). It was
verified numerically in [73]. This behaviour is not anymore true for w < 1/3. Something obvious in
the case of dust w = 0, since f(0) = 0.6, but δc(w = 0) = 0 always for any profile. This is shown in
the left panel of Fig.14. It should be taken into account that beyond q > 40, simulations do not obtain
the threshold with enough resolution. This is the reason why the numerical value of the threshold
for w = 1/3 does not exactly coincide with f(1/3) . One expects that in the asymptotic limit, q → ∞
should match with f(1/3) as was pointed out in [72] with the same argument.

analytical case f(w), where the black dots correspond to the numerical simulations in the region where
δc(q → ∞) 6= f(w) as shown in [77]. The blue dashed line corresponds to f(w) on that region.
It is interesting also to notice the difference between consider K(r) and ζ(r˜). As we have seen in section
4, there is a non-linear relation between ζ and C, which leads to some differences between the thresholds
obtained for both profiles. Consider for instance a Gaussian profile in both cases, i.e, K(r) = A e
−(r/rm)
2
and ζ(r) = µ e
−(r/rm)
2
. Due to the non-linear relation between C and ζ at super-horizon scales, the δm,ζ
(for this example let’s call δm,K and δm,ζ
for both profiles) depends non-linearly on µ as,
δm,K = f(w)Ar
2
me

,
δm,ζ = 4 f(w)(e − µ)µe

. (87)
Due to this, the qζ value in the case of the fluctuation ζ is dependent also on its amplitude µ and w,
qζ =
e
2
(e − 2µ)
(e − µ)(e
2 − 6 f(w)µ + 6 f(w)µ2)
, (88)
when for the K(r) in this example is just q = 1. A plot on the thresholds δc for both profiles can be found in
Fig.15 for different w’s. Although both profiles are Gaussian, they have a different δc due to the non-linear
relation with ζ(r˜). The threshold for ζ(r˜) is higher than K(r) since the shape around the compaction
function is sharper, which means a larger q, as can be observed in the bottom panel of the subplot in Fig.15.
It also has an implication for the PBH mass, as we will see in the next subsection.

was considered in [104] for estimation of
PBH abundances taking into account the non-linearity of ζ(r˜) for w = 1/3. There was found a range of
thresholds 0.442 < δc < 0.656 for 0.34 . p . 2.
6.4. PBH masses
Once the apparent horizon is formed, an excision technique following section 5.3 can be applied to
remove the singularity. An example of the evolution of the PBH mass MPBH(t) for the profile of Eq.81
with q = 1, λ = 0 and different amplitudes δm can be found in Fig. 16. The initial time of the curves
corresponds to the initial mass of the PBH MPBH,i at the time of formation of the apparent horizon tAH.
As can be seen in Fig.16, when the amplitudes δm increase the PBH mass will be higher.

profile of Eq.81 with q = 1 and λ = 0. The colour lines correspond to different values of initial amplitudes
δm. The dashed line corresponds to the analytical fit using Eq.54. Threshold value δc = 0.49774 ± 2 · 10−5
.

Figure 17. Top panel: Time evolution of the Hamiltonian constraint for different amplitude values δm
during the excision procedure. Bottom panel: Numerical evolution of Ψ in time. The crossing point is
around t/tm ≈ 37.5. The profile used is the same as in Fig.16.
The amount of time needed until reach the stationary regime where the PBH mass remains constant
could be substantial and therefore computationally expensive. As we have mentioned, to avoid that can
be used Eq.54 to estimate the final mass of the PBH after the accretion process accurately.
In order to find the domain in time where the approximation of Eq.54 is valid, in [73] was computed
the ratio of the increment in time of the black hole mass with respect to the Hubble scale Ψ = M˙ /HM,
which is predicted to be Ψ < 1 when the evolution of the PBH mass satisfies this regime. During the
application of the excision technique, the Hamiltonian constraint is monotorized using Eq.72. In the
simulations in [73,80] the constraint is fulfill until very late times, as is shown in Fig. 17. Nevertheless,
it seems that the evolution of the mass was not affected substantially by the violation of the constraint.
Interestingly, in the bottom panel of Fig.17 was observed a crossing for different evolutions of Ψ at a given
time t
∗
. In Fig.18 is shown the evolution of MPBH(t) in time for different values of q and two different
profiles. It is clear that as large is q less is the final PBH mass MPBH,f, since the pressure gradients are
stronger and prevent accretion from the FLRW background. Notice the differences of MPBH(t) between
the two profiles considered in the figure. Even with the same q, the values for the mass are different since
the full shape of the profile will contribute to the final mass.

to Eq.81 with λ = 0 and solid line to Eq.80. Bottom: Time evolution of the Hamiltonian constraint. In all
cases δm − δc = 5 · 10−3
.
To get the parameters ta, Ma and F can be performed a non-linear fit using the function of Eq.54 with
the data MPBH(t) coming from the simulations. The range of values to make the fit are those which fulfill
Ψ . 0.1. The values of F that has been obtained in the literature making the non-linear fit have been in the
range F ∈ [3.2, 3.8] (for the case of w = 1/3) in terms of the different profiles and amplitudes δm. Some
indicative results regarding the accuracy of the fits done are: σmax ≈ 10−2
(variance) sd
(Ma) = 10−4.2
,
sd
(ta) = 10−4.1 and sd
(F) = 10−3.6, where sd
is the standard deviation of the parameters. It is consistent
with what already was stated in [139–141] that the numerical coefficient F must be O(1). In particular, in
the case of the collapse of domain walls was found F ≈ 3.8 for large black holes[143].
Interestingly, in [80] was quantified the effect of the accretion (from the FLRW background) to the
grow of the PBH until reach the stationary regime, namely MPBH, f /MPBH,i
, for the case w = 1/3. As
was pointed out, the accretion should not be important for small PBHs, i.e, with δm near the δc. But the
situation differs for relatively large PBHs. It can be seen precisely seen in Fig.19. The accretion can be
significantly important for large δm.
Sharp profiles, corresponding to large q, have larger pressure gradients and therefore the ratio
MPBH,f/MPBH,i is smaller, even for large δm, since the gradients prevent the accretion. For low MPBH,f the
ratio MPBH,f/MPBH,i should be small, as expected [7,79]. When MPBH,f ' MH, i.e. for PBHs with higher
probability to form, was obtained MPBH,f ' 3MH. In comparison, a similar result was also found in the
case of the collapse of a massless scalar field [138] and in [143,195] from BHs formed from the collapse of
domain walls or vacuum bubbles, with a factor MPBH,f/MBH,i ≤ 2.

Figure 19. Accretion effect on the final PBH mass measured as the ratio MPBH,f/MPBH,i in terms of
δm − δc(q) for different profiles with w = 1/3. Stars to Eq.81 with λ = 0, circles correspond to Eq.80 and
triangles to Eq.84. The ratio MPBH,f/MPBH,i for PBHs with MPBH,f ' MH is shown in the subplot.
An example of values of PBH mass for other values of w can be found in Fig.20, where is shown the
ratio MPBH, f /MH using a Gaussian profile Eq.81 with q = 1 (λ = 0) for those PBHs MPBH, f /MH ≈ 1. The
PBH mass MPBH, f
is very sensitive to w as expected. When w increases, gradients are larger, preventing
the accretion and the increase of the PBH mass. The ratio MPBH, f /MH is larger for smaller w at the same
δm − δc, since the accretion is substantially higher when pressure gradients are decreased, as can be seen in
the bottom panel of Fig.20. In this case, the values of F differ substantially from w = 1/3. In particular, for
the set of values w ∈ [0.2, 1/3, 0.5, 0.7] it corresponds to F ≈ [7.2, 3.8, 2.0, 1.37] respectively, which already
clearly indicates the substantial accretion for small w. Moreover, the time needed to reach the asymptotic
regime of Eq.54 is much higher as smaller is w. For example, in the case of δm − δc = 10−2
for w = 0.2
and w = 0.5, was needed a time of order t/t0 v 104 and t/t0 v 103
respectively to reach the asymptotic
regime.

Bottom panel: Accretion effect on the final PBH mass for some values of w in terms of δm − δc. In both cases
has been used the profile of Eq.81 with q = 1 and λ = 0.
On the other hand, in [79] were made some analytical approximations regarding the maximum size
of the PBHs fromed from hydrodynamical perturbations at the time of formation of the apparent horizon,
in particular was found that:

This analytical result (derived for 0 < w ≤ 1) was verified numerically in the case of a radiation fluid
in [80], where was also performed an extensive study on the values MPBH,i, RPBH,i and tAH for different
profiles and amplitudes δm.
To compute the value of the constant K in front the scaling law Eq.56 is needed to estimate the
final mass of the black hole MPBH, f using perturbations with an amplitude near the critical regime, i.e,
δ → δc. A range of 10−3 . δ − δc . 10−2
is sufficient to estimate it, since the gravitational collapse of the
fluctuations happens in the critical regime. Beyond that, the scaling law becomes deviated. In particular,
for a radiation fluid can be taken directly the value γ = 0.357 [59,196] to obtain K from a given δm − δc (for
other values of w check Fig.3 and the caption).
In Fig.21 are shown the values of K for the profiles of Eq.80, Eq.81 and Eq.84 as an example on how
changes K changes in terms of the profile. The value of the PBH mass MPBH,f (and therefore also K) is
affected by the shape of the profile beyond the peak of C since the accretion process depends on the full
shape of the fluctuation, in comparison with the threshold δc that as was pointed out in section 6.2 mainly
depends on the shape around the compaction function peak.

,
Ctt(peak,2) = 0.3, and δ2 is obtained from Eq.86 using the previous values with and q1 = q.
In the case of the profile Eq.80, K tends to ≈ 3.5 for large values of q. The value of K tend to increase
as q decreases, as shown Fig.21. Numerically, in [80] was not able to obtain the final mass MPBH,f for
profiles q . 0.5, due to conic singularities, as was already found in [77].
On the other hand, in Fig.22 can be seen an explicit example of MPBH, f
for a Gaussian profile (in both
K(r) and ζ(r)) in terms of MH for large values of δm beyond the critical regime δm & 10−2 with w = 1/3.
As can be observed in the subplot of Fig. 22, the scaling law deviates for the highest allowed values of δm
to O(15% − 20%) for both cases. For this particular cases, the maximum allowed mass of the PBH formed
is MPBH, f ≈ 3.7MH and MPBH, f ≈ 2.3MH respectively. It is expected in principle that this deviation
from the scaling regime is not going to significantly modify the estimation of the PBH abundance, due
to the unusualness of such perturbations since those PBHs with the higher probability to form are with
MPBH, f ≈ MH. It is important to also notice that the masses generated with the profile ζ(r˜) are lower
than those with K(r), since although they are both Gaussian, they have q > 1 and q = 1 respectively, and
sharper profiles have less mass due to stronger pressure gradients, as we have seen in Fig.18.

this profile. In both cases w = 1/3.
7. Analytical estimation for the threshold of PBH formation
In this section, we review in detail the current analytical estimations used in the literature for the
threshold of PBH formation from curvature fluctuations with an equation of state w. The first analytical
estimation came from [67], where using a Jeans length approximation was shown that,
δCarr = w . (90)
Although this approximation is simply, it fulfill some properties: i) at w = 0 (dust) any curvature
fluctuation should collapse, i.e, δc(w = 0) = 0. ii) as large as w pressure gradients are larger, so the
threshold should be higher. This approximation was obtained assuming the argument that the size of an
overdensity (that leads to PBH formation), at the maximum expansion, should be smaller than the particle
horizon and larger than the Jean radius (Jeans criteria). In particular,
RJ . Rmax . RPH, (91)
where RPH v

3/8πρmax, RJ v csRPH. See also section 2 for a simple derivation.
Later on, in [68] improved the previous estimation of [67] by using a sophisticated and interesting
model (a three-zone model) of the collapse of a homogeneous overdense sphere surrounded by a thin
underdense shell. We suggest the reader check [68] for more details on the model and assumptions done.

These previous estimations (in particular Eq.92) have been extensively used in the literature, but as was
already noticed [67,68] these estimations are not profile dependent and therefore do not take into account
the specific shape of the curvature fluctuation.
7.1. Shape-dependent analytical estimation of the threshold for radiation fluid
In [76] was pointed out and proved that, to a very good approximation, the threshold for the w = 1/3
case only depends upon the curvature of the compaction function at its maximum, under the assumption
of a central over-dense peak in the density distribution. It was used to build an analytical formula for
the threshold with a dependence on the profile considered. The formula was accurate enough and only
deviated 2% in comparison with numerical simulations.
The main two ingredients of the procedure used in [76] were: i) parametrize the shape around the
compaction function peak with a dimensionless parameter q ii) use the average of the critical compaction
function. As was shown in [76] and as we have already mentioned, to a very good approximation, the
threshold only depends on,
q ≡ −
r
2
m C
00(rm)
4 C(rm)
, (95)
which is a dimensionless measure of the curvature of C(r) at its maximum. This means that different
profiles but with the same q value will have the same threshold upon a small deviation of < 2%.
The next point is to define a “basis” (or fiducial set of curvature profiles) such that, by varying q, this
set covers the whole range of interesting thresholds and shapes with q ∈ (0, ∞) while also being regular
at r = 0 and having ρ
0
(r = 0, t) = 0. In [76], this basis was given in terms of the exponential functions
Eq.81 (with λ = 0). Although it strictly does not satisfy regular conditions for q → 0 at r = 0, this limit
was tested numerically with the polynomial basis of Eq.80.
Taking into account this, the averaged critical compaction function integrated from r = 0 up to the
peak r = rm is defined as,
C¯

where Γ(x)

is the incomplete gamma function and we have used
Cc(rm) ≡ δc. In the case of a radiation fluid, when q → ∞, it was confirmed numerically that δc(q → ∞) =
f(w = 1/3) = 2/3 [72]. Taking into account this analytical limit into Eq.97, we get:
C¯
c(q → ∞) = 3
5
δc(q → ∞) = 2
5
. (98)
The assumption done in [76] was to consider that C¯
c is a profile-independent quantity, and therefore
C¯
c = 2/5 for any value of q. The assumption was tested extensively numerically for different profiles, and
was found to be consistent with numerical simulations up to a small deviation of O(2%) in δc. Inverting
Eq.97 in δc with C¯
c = 2/5, we finally get the analytical threshold formula δc in terms of the specific profile
q, in the case of a radiation fluid,

This remarkable result in [76] was the first analytical estimation shown in the literature for the threshold
of PBH formation, taking into account the shape of the fluctuation, with enough accuracy to be used for
estimations of PBH abundances [92]. A plot of Eq.99 in terms of q can be found in Fig.23.
Figure 23. Plot δc(q) of Eq.99.
7.2. Generalization of the analytical threshold beyond radiation fluid
Later on, the procedure used in [76] was generalized considering PBH formation within a perfect
fluid with w ∈ (0, 1] on a FLRW background, and was found that the threshold averaged compaction
function within a concentric sphere of radius rm(1 − α(w)) ≤ r ≤ rm, is, to a very good approximation,
again universal in the case 1/3 ≤ w < 1. This was used to provide a new and improved analytical formula
for the threshold that only depends upon the normalized second derivative of the compaction function at
its maximum and the equation of state w. This formula was proved to be accurate at order 6% compared
to numerical simulations and reproducing the same result for the case of radiation w = 1/3.

In [76], the basis profiles used were given in terms of the exponential functions; although that, since
the boundary conditions at r = 0 are violated for q < 1/2, was considered the basis profile of Eq.80 instead.
This set of profiles satisfies the appropriate boundary and regularity conditions.
The critical compaction function, averaged within a spherical shell extending from radius [1− α(w)]rm
to rm (the peak), is defined to be

The key point is that as was shown numerically in [77] the dependence of the averaged critical
compaction function on the profile shape is weak enough to be ignored, and therefore universal. Then,
C¯

The functions α(w) and C¯
c(w) were found using two different procedures: i) a numerical double fit
minimization using the numerical results of the thresholds for different profiles ii) and making a single
numerical fit minimization using already the analytical result that δc(q → ∞) for w ≥ 1/3. Both procedures
gave equivalent results. Therefore, the assumption of C¯
c(w) being universal was found good enough
and verified numerically for w & 1/3. This result verified the previous one obtained for a radiation fluid

7.3. A Comparison between analytical estimates
In [77] was compared the analytical estimation obtained Eq.106 with the previous ones in the literature,
i.e, Eq.90,92. In Fig.24 is shown the comparison. The solid lines in Fig.24 show these approximations; the
symbols with error bars show δc(w) from numerical simulations of the profiles of Eq.80 with q = 0.015,
q = 0.1, q = 1 and q = 30. The dotted and dashed curves, which describe significantly better the result of
the numerical simulations, show the result of inserting Eqs.107 and 108, or Eqs.109 and 110, in the Eq.106.
In both cases, Eq.106 (as well as the simulations) exceeds even the upper bound claimed by [68] at even
lower w as q increases, which are Eqs.93,94.
Figure 24. Dependence of threshold δc on w when the initial profile is given by Eq.81 with q = 30, q = 1,
q = 0.1, q = 0.015 and λ = 0 in all the cases (q = 0 would be a homogeneous sphere). The solid lines with
dots and error bars show the results of the numerical simulations. The green and blue curves show the
minimal and maximal bounds of δc from [68], in particular Eq.94 and Eq.93 respectively. The magenta line
shows the approximation for δCarr of Eq.90. The black curve shows δHYK from Eq.92. The other curves
show the approximation (Eq.106) in which δc depends both on w and q. Finally, the dotted curves uses
Eqs.109 and 110 in Eq.106 whereas the dashed curves use Eqs.107 and 108 in Eq.106.
As can be observed, the discrepancy of the estimations Eq.90,92 for the case of small w is as large as
50% for the case q = 0.1. This is the limit that was considered successful and optimal for the approximations
on which Eq.92 is based. This deviation is even bigger than the one found earlier because Eq.92 was
compared with a Gaussian profile (Eq.81 with q = 1 and λ = 0). Actually, in the case w < 0.15 the
solid black curve in Fig.24 does give a satisfactory description of the simulations with q = 1. However,
the top-hat profile with q → 0, which is the one used in the analytic estimations of [68], is quite better
43 of 58
approximated by q  1. For q = 0.1, the formula Eq.92 does not describe the simulations particularly well,
and the discrepancy at w < 1/3 is even worse when q = 0.015 is taken. It was claimed in [77] that this
disagreement seems to suggest that the supposed agreement shown in Fig.3 of [68] is a result of numerical
coincidences, with no physics implications.
Finally, the polynomial basis profile of Eq.80 fulfills regularity conditions for q → as we have pointed
out before, something not fulfilled with the exponential basis Eq.81 (with λ = 0). Precisely, this lead in
previous literature [72] to infer that the minimum threshold for PBH formation (in the case of a radiation
fluid) must coincide to the estimation of [68], i.e, δc,min(w = 1/3) = δHYK(w = 1/3) ≈ 0.41. In [72], was
possible to compute δc with q = 0.1 as smaller value using Eq.81 (with λ = 0), since as was indicated there,
the profiles were too sharp. This actually looks related to the fact that the exponential profile Eq.81 does
not satisfy regularity conditions at r → 0 for q < 0.5. Instead, in the case of using the polynomial profile
Eq.80 it allows to do simulations even to smaller values in q, up to q = 0.01, as were done in [76]. Therefore
this leads to the conclusion in [76] that, for a radiation fluid, the correct range of values for the threshold is
0.4 ≤ δc ≤ 2/3, and therefore the minimum value was lower than δHYK. Indeed, the generalization of δc in
w already indicates that the minimum threshold should not correspond necessarily to the one of δHYK.
8. Other scenarios of PBH formation
In this review paper, we have mainly focused on the study of PBH formation from the spherical
collapse of primordial density perturbations, which is currently the case most studied in the literature and
with more results and applications [32]. Although that, many other mechanisms and scenarios could have
led to black holes formed in the very early Universe [9]. In this last section, we try to briefly enumerate
other scenarios beyond the ones considered in this review.
The case w = 0 is very special as the threshold of PBH formation, for an infinitely long matter
domination era, is 0. Thus a study of abundances, where the Universe is matter-dominated for a finite
time, differs a lot from the case of radiation. Some works have considered this scenario with scalar
fields type [198–203], specially taking into account the oscillatory behavior of scalar field during the
reheating. Recently in [204] were performed simulations in full GR using scalar fields to modulate the
perturbation and the expanding dust background of the Universe, showing that the PBH mass grows
beyond the self-similar limit MPBH ∝ H−1
, at least initially. The dust collapse has also been studied in a
more oriented perfect fluid scenario [205]. The PBH formation has also been considered in the context of
the LTB (Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi) model [206,207]. In [208] was studied the effect of inhomogeneity on
PBH formation in the matter-dominated era and its consequences on the PBH production. On the other
hand, in[209,210] was studied the non-spherical effects and spins for PBH formation in the case of dust
dominated Universe, showing it could have a significant effect.
A non-spherical effect, in principle, could dramatically change the threshold value and PBH mass
[211]. Some analytical estimations taking into account an ellipsoidal collapse were done in the past,
showing that the effect could be important [206,212]. However, in [213], for the first time in the literature,
was performed the first numerical simulation in 3 + 1 spacetime (beyond spherical symmetry) for PBH
formation from the collapse of curvature fluctuations, with a small (perturbative) non-sphericity initial
condition (with a radiation fluid). The main conclusion was that the effect of ellipticity on the threshold
for PBH formation is negligible in the standard scenario of PBH formation in the radiation-dominated
Universe. This situation could dramatically change if it is considered an equation of state different from
radiation as indicated in [213]. In particular, for a matter-dominated Universe, the effect of any sphericity
could be important [205,209,210]. Another possibility is the inclusion of angular momentum to analyze
the spin generation to PBHs; some analytical estimations have been done [214], but still are necessary
44 of 58
numerical simulations to test those arguments. Recently has also been considered analytically PBH
formation with an anisotropic perfect fluid [215].
The usual scenario of the collapse of cosmological density perturbations considers a constant equation
of state w (mainly w = 1/3 in the literature). But the Universe has a thermal history where the equation of
state is not necessarily constant, i.e, w(t). A particular (and very popular) example applied to the PBH
scenario is the QCD epoch [216–219]. During the QCD phase transition, the equation of state w could have
been softened. Looking at the result of the simulations in Fig.24 it is already clear that the threshold δc will
be reduced, and therefore, makes the formation probability of PBHs exponentially more likely. Several
works have addressed this scenario with progressive refinements [216,220–225], specially with the new
calculations regarding lattice QCD [226,227]. However, numerical simulations are still needed to fully
verify the effect on how much could change the threshold, PBH mass and mass function modifying the
equation of state in time.
A bit more different mechanism of PBH formation comes from the collapse of Q-balls and Oscillons,
which are features of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model [228]. Specific realizations of
those ideas are done throughout theory motivated scalar field potentials, e.g, the axion-monodromy
potential [229]. The mechanism for PBH formation of all these cases is naively similar: small number
densities of defects lead to large fluctuations relative to the background density. These fluctuations become
gravitationally bound and collapse to form black holes once the relic density has come to dominate. Finally,
the relics decay due to some instabilities. Precisely, it has been argued that some solitonic type solutions
like Q-balls and Oscillons could produce a significant fraction of dark matter in the form of PBHs [230–234],
without relying on any spectrum of density perturbations.
On the other hand, scalar force instability can lead to a growth of structures and formation of halos of
interacting particles (even on a radiation dominated Universe) [235–239]. Actually, in [238] was theorized
that these structures could have collapsed and formed PBHs, but later on, it was realized that they should
remain as virialized dark matter [239]. Precisely, in [240] it was shown that the radiative cooling due to
the scalar radiation allows those halos to collapse into black holes. This was shown with a simple model
with fermions interacting via Yukawa interaction. The general relativistic formulation of the interaction
between a Fermi gas and a scalar field in cosmology has been carefully studied recently in detail in [241].
All these mechanisms could have small or large spins in terms of their formation evolution and the
process of radiative cooling, as was pointed out in [211]. Another proposal is the one in [242], where the
dilution of heavy quarks produced during inflation, which get confined by QCD flux tubes after horizon
re-entry, could have led to PBH production.
Another mechanism is through the collapse of domain walls. Domain walls are topological defects
that may form when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken in the very early Universe [243,244].
Several works have addressed this scenario and have shown the possibility to form PBHs and with
astrophysical consequences [245–249]. Another possibility comes from the collapse of cosmic strings
[250–252], which are 1 + 1 topological defects that are predicted beyond the Standard Model and could
have lead to production of PBHs [253–259].
Similarly, it was also shown that vacuum bubbles could lead to a successful channel for PBH
production or also been involved in related mechanisms [195,260–266]. They could have been formed
during the inflationary epoch through a nucleation process. After inflation and depending on their size,
these bubbles could collapse or even collide, forming black holes [179,193,246,267,268].
Other results has been also pointed out in the context of modified gravity, in particular in [269]
was studied the PBH production in G-inflation and also in [270] was studied with the inclusion of a
Gauss-Bonnet term. In [271] were considered the effects on the threshold in Eddington-inspired-Born-Infeld
gravity.

Finally, a new mechanism appeared in [272], where PBHs could have been formed from the collapse
of primordial CDM isocurvature fluctuations.
9. Conclusions
In this review, we have focused on explaining in detail the process of PBH formation from the collapse
of curvature fluctuations under spherical symmetry and its numerical implementation through a particular
numerical technique. Specifically, we have seen that numerical simulations are essential to capture the
correct and full-non linear behaviour of the collapse and formation of the PBHs. It leads to a better
and accurate determination of the threshold of PBH formation and its masses compared to analytical
estimations, something essential for the precise analysis of PBH abundances. In this review, we have seen
a simple and efficient numerical procedure based on pseudospectral methods that allow us to fully solve
the non-linear gravitational collapse of those perturbations and obtain the needed values of the threshold
and PBH mass in the range of practical interest.
Two aspects in the literature have been remarkable important for the development of the field: i)
the results found from numerical simulations about the critical scaling regime for the PBH mass ii) and
the analytical estimations for the threshold of PBH formation. Both allow us to estimate the abundances
of PBHs and constraint them. In particular, we have seen that the threshold and PBH mass are both
dependent on the specific shape of the curvature fluctuation considered, and it’s crucial to take this into
account for the precise analysis of PBH abundances instead of using a constant threshold or PBH mass
value. Moreover, we have seen that the gravitational collapse is highly dependent on the equation of state
of the fluid w. As large is w, smaller is the mass of the PBHs and the accretion from the FLRW background,
but higher the threshold.
It is interesting to mention that the compaction function, firstly used in [70] years ago, has become
nowadays essential. Not only for the definition of the threshold of PBH formation but also to obtain an
analytical estimation of it, using its average.
There is still a lot of effort to be done in other directions and to consider different scenarios of
PBH formation, as the ones already pointed out in section 8. Future theoretical developments and the
implementation of numerical simulations to test and check those scenarios could lead to new possibilities
for PBHs to account for dark matter and update the abundance estimations. In particular, it would be
interesting to compare the results already pointed out in this review in other scenarios.
We hope that in the next few years, several scientific results in this and other directions will help to
fully understand and constrain the PBH scenario and its consequences in our Universe, especially taking
into account future gravitational waves observations.
