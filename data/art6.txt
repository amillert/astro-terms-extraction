General Analytical Conditions for Inflaton Fragmentation: Quick and Easy Tests for its Occurrence
Understanding the physics of inflaton condensate fragmentation in the early Universe is crucial as the existence of fragments in the form of non-topological solitons (oscillons or Q-balls) may potentially modify the
evolution of the post-inflation Universe. Furthermore, such fragments may evolve into primordial black holes
and form dark matter, or emit gravitational waves. Due to the non-perturbative and non-linear nature of the
dynamics, most of the studies rely on numerical lattice simulations. Numerical simulations of condensate fragmentation are, however, challenging, and, without knowing where to look in the parameter space, they are likely
to be time-consuming as well. In this paper, we provide generic analytical conditions for the perturbations of an
inflaton condensate to undergo growth to non-linearity in the cases of both symmetric and asymmetric inflaton
potentials. We apply the conditions to various inflation models and demonstrate that our results are in good
agreement with explicit numerical simulations. Our analytical conditions are easy to use and may be utilised
in order to quickly identify models that may undergo fragmentation and determine conditions under they do so,
which can guide subsequent in-depth numerical analyses.
I. INTRODUCTION
After inflation ends, a real scalar inflaton field starts to oscillate around the minimum of its potential. An attractive inflaton self-interaction may then result in growth of perturbations of the inflaton to non-linearity and, if non-topological
soliton (NTS) solutions exist, which will be the case in the
models we consider, subsequent fragmentation of the inflaton condensate1
. The inflaton condensate fragments correspond to oscillons, which are spherically symmetric quasistable NTS [1]. The longevity of oscillons can be understood
by the conservation of adiabatic charge [2].
The study of inflaton condensate fragmentation has gained
much attention partly due to the interesting consequences of
the fragments. Examples include primordial black hole formation due to the statistics of fragments [3–5], gravitational
wave signals associated with fragments [6–9], and changes in
reheating dynamics which lead to a different cosmic evolution
[10, 11].
The evolution dynamics of the fragments often requires numerical lattice simulations due to the non-perturbative and
non-linear nature. Most of the existing literature adapts numerical approaches and performs extensive lattice simulations. Numerical simulations are, however, often technically
challenging and computationally demanding, and can obscure
the underlying physics. Furthermore, without knowing where
to look in the model parameter space, or if fragmentation is
1
It is important to distinguish between the growth of perturbations of a scalar
field to non-linearity and condensate fragmentation. The latter requires that
discrete NTS solutions exist, so that the condensate may break up into discrete NTS with vacuum between them. The condition for NTS to be possible in models that grow to non-linearity is that the scalars are sufficiently
massive in the vacuum so that the energy per scalar in the NTS can be less
than the mass of the scalar in the vacuum. This will be generally true of the
potentials that we will consider.
even possible in a given model, numerical studies can be timeconsuming. Having an analytical expression for the condition
under which the condensate is likely to undergo non-linear
growth and hence, if discrete NTS solutions exist, fragmentation, would be greatly beneficial for such in-depth numerical analyses. Such a condition could serve as a starting point
of extensive numerical analyses, and it could also be used to
quickly estimate the likelihood of fragmentation in a given
model. We expect that NTS will exist in the models that
we consider, therefore, in the following, we will consider the
growth of perturbations to non-linearity and fragmentation to
be equivalent.
The aim of this paper is to provide general analytical conditions for perturbations of an inflaton condensate to grow to become non-linear and hence for inflaton condensate fragmentation to be possible. In Ref. [12] we studied the stability of an
inflaton condensate, based on Ref. [1], for the case of a general
symmetric potential. We obtained analytical conditions on the
self-interaction couplings under which the condensate undergoes fragmentation. However, the method of Ref. [12] cannot
be used when the potential is asymmetric. In this work, we
generalise the analysis of Ref. [12] to encompass asymmetric
potentials, thus allowing the condition for fragmentation to be
determined for a wide range of inflaton potentials.
In the next section, we develop an analytical framework for
studying the growth of inflaton field perturbations and inflaton condensate fragmentation. We then provide the analytical
conditions under which the condensate grows to non-linearity
and fragments for both symmetric and asymmetric potentials.
The main results of the paper are summarised in Sec. II D.
In Sec. III, we apply our analytical results to four examples for which numerical results are available: the α-attractor
T-model, the α-attractor E-model, Starobinsky’s R
2 model,
and the Palatini R
2 model with a quadratic potential. In addition, we apply our results to a model which has not yet been
studied numerically, Higgs Inflation with a general symmetrybreaking potential in both the metric and Palatini formulations, and we perform lattice simulations to test our analytical
results. We show that our results are in good agreement with

numerical simulations in all cases, thus demonstrating their
general effectiveness. We conclude in Sec. IV.
II. GENERAL TREATMENT
A. Inflaton condensate
Consider a real scalar field Φ whose equation of motion2
is
given by
Φ¨ +3HΦ˙ −

2Φ
a
2
+VΦ = 0, (1)
where the dot denotes the cosmic time derivative and VΦ ≡
dV(Φ)/dΦ.
In our analysis, we will be considering a potential that is
close to a quadratic potential, so to a first approximation, the
field will undergo coherent oscillations in a quadratic potential. We expect that any potential that is capable of supporting
NTS solutions will be approximately quadratic at the minimum of its potential, as it is necessary for the scalars to have
a non-zero mass in the vacuum in order for the NTS solutions
to have a lower energy per scalar and so to be (meta)stable.
Defining Φ = (a0/a)

coherent oscillations start at a = a0, gives

In the case of a symmetric potential, V(Φ) = V(−Φ), the
oscillatory behaviour of the scalar field can well be described
by φ(t,x) = RcosΩ, where R and Ω are both functions of t
and x. The inflaton condensate fragmentation in symmetric
potentials is studied in Ref. [12]. For asymmetric potentials,
V(Φ) 6= V(−Φ), however, the analysis of Ref. [12] cannot
be applied as the choice of φ = RcosΩ does not capture the
asymmetric feature. In the case of an asymmetric potential,
we expect the amplitude of the oscillating field to be different
at Ω = 0 and Ω = π. Assuming that the potential is dominated
by a quadratic term, one may model this by considering
φ = R(1+ε cosΩ) cosΩ, (5)
where ε  1 parametrises the asymmetry of the potential. The
form of ε can be determined once the potential is specified.
2 Throughout the paper, we work in the Einstein frame with a canonically
normalised kinetic term, unless otherwise stated.
We explore the case of an asymmetric potential in more detail in Sec. II C. Note that the symmetric potential case corresponds to the ε → 0 limit. Thus, Eq. (5) may be used to
describe the inflaton condensate motion for a generic form of
potential.
The equation of motion (2) can be expressed in terms of
R = R(t,x) and Ω = Ω(t,x) as
0 = R¨(1+ε cosΩ) cosΩ−2R˙Ω˙ (1+2ε cosΩ)sinΩ

Ω¨ +2R˙Ω˙ /R−2∇R·∇Ω/(a

where U

∂φ i. Here, we have assumed that R and
Ω˙ do not change much over the period of oscillations, which
is a good approximation when the potential is dominated by
the quadratic term. Furthermore, we assume that ∆H term is
small enough to be ignored, which is a good approximation
if ω & H, where ω is the oscillation frequency, because ∆H is
effectively constant on the time scale of coherent oscillations.
We note that Eqs. (7) and (8) have the same form as those
studied in Ref. [12]. We can thus follow the same procedure
as Ref. [12]. For completeness, we repeat the procedure.
We expand R and Ω into their background parts and perturbations parts as
R(t,x) = R0(t) +δR(t,x), Ω(t,x) = Ω0(t) +δΩ(t,x). (9)
with R0 and Ω0 being the solutions of Eqs. (7) and (8). It is
straightforward to show that the perturbations satisfy

As a condition for fragmentation, we require S ∼
ln(R0/δR0), which results in non-linear perturbations, i.e.,
δR/R ∼ 1. The primordial inflaton perturbation, δR0/R0 ∼
10−4
, can be used as the initial perturbation. Thus, the condition for growth to non-linearity and so fragmentation is given
by
S(k,a(t)) > 10. (20)
The discussion above is applicable for a general potential.
The polynomial expansion of a general potential is expected
to have a leading-order quartic or cubic interactions for a symmetric potential or an asymmetric potential, respectively. The
fragmentation condition (20) can then be converted into a
bound on the model parameters. In the following two subsections, we discuss the case of a symmetric and an asymmetric
potential respectively and obtain the condition on the model
parameters for fragmentation to occur.
B. Symmetric potentials
Let us consider
V(Φ) = 1
2
m
2Φ
2 −AΦ
4
, (21)
where A > 0. The quadratic term is assumed to be dominant.
The leading-order quartic self-interaction is expected to naturally arise in the polynomial expansion of a general symmetric
potential3
. The condition for fragmentation to occur with the
quartic self-interaction was studied in detail in Ref. [12]. For
completeness, we repeat the calculation here.
As the potential is symmetric under Φ → −Φ, we may set
ε = 0 in Eq. (5) and obtain the following effective potential,

The upper limit of the comoving wavenumber, kmax, is then
given by Eq. (17),
kmax ≈
√
6ARa3/2
0
a
−1/2
. (23)
We note that kmax ∝ a
−1/2
. For a mode k < kmax, the mode is
initially growing. Eventually, the mode k will become larger
than kmax since kmax decreases as a increases. Therefore, the
mode will stop growing.
The maximum possible growth of a mode is found by first
considering k < kmax,0 at an initial scale factor a0. At a later
scale factor af at which k = kmax, the growth stops. We compute the corresponding growth factor S(k,af) and maximise
S(k,af) with respect to k and af
. In this way, we determine the
maximum possible growth of a mode starting at a0.
Using Eq. (19), we obtain the growth factor from a0 to af
as follows:

a0, to be as large as possible while being consistent with the
assumption that the potential is dominated by the quadratic
term. We define the ratio between the quartic part and the

C. Asymmetric potentials
Next, we consider a typical asymmetric potential which, in
the small field region where inflaton starts to oscillate around
the minimum of the potential after inflation ends, can generically be described by the leading-order cubic term,
V(Φ) = 1
2

. (33)
The quadratic term is assumed to be the dominant term in the
potential as before. The sign of the cubic term is chosen in
such a way that A takes a positive value.
In the case of asymmetric potentials, ε in Eq. (5) takes a
non-zero value. To find ε, let us assume that the field reaches
maximum at Φ = Φ± with Φ˙ = 0, where Φ± = ±(Φ0 ±δΦ)
for the − sign in the potential (33) and Φ± = ±(Φ0 ∓δΦ) for
the + sign in the potential (33). Here, Φ0,δΦ > 0. Note that
δΦ → 0 as A → 0. From V(Φ+) = V(Φ−), we find that δΦ =
AΦ2

parameter ε can be determined as
ε = ±

representing the deviation from the quadratic term.

We see that kmax ∝ a

starts. Therefore, the maximum growth corresponds to a mode

These are the main results of the paper.
Strictly speaking, these conditions are sufficient conditions
for fragmentation, as they show that if the condensate forms it
will fragments, hence fragmentation is guaranteed if our conditions are satisfied. In our analysis, we are restricting the
initial value of the field to be close enough to the minimum of
the potential that the potential is dominated by the quadratic
term. However, it is possible that fragmentation could occur
more rapidly and at larger field values due to tachyonic preheating, in which case it is possible that fragmentation could
still occur even if our conditions are not satisfied. In practice, as we will demonstrate via a range of examples below,
we find that quite generally our conditions accurately predict
the conditions under which fragmentation occurs in numerical
simulations.
In the next section we will apply our analytical conditions
to various examples of inflation models and compare them
with the known numerical results in order to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our analytic fragmentation conditions.

Therefore, by substituting m and A into Eq. (42), we see that

Thus, in the α-attractor T-model, fragmentation of the inflaton condensate will occur for α . 5 × 10−5

[11], which demonstrates fragmentation for an explicit example with α ≈ 10−5
, but finds no fragmentation for larger values
of α.

Thus, in the α-attractor E-model, fragmentation of the inflaton condensate will occur for α . 5 × 10−3

[16], where it is concluded that fragmentation will occur for
α . 10−3

We note that this potential can be obtained from the αattractor E-model potential (48) by setting α = 1. From Eq.

not occur in the R
2 model. This is consistent with the results
of Ref. [18].

To match the magnitude of the primordial curvature power
spectrum, 2×10−9

then [21]
α & 2.94×1013

The same lower bound of 1013 was later found in Ref. [20]
by performing a numerical analysis of tachyonic preheating
in this model.
E. Higgs Inflation
In the previous sections we considered models for which
a numerical analysis of fragmentation already exists, and we
demonstrated that our simple analytical conditions can reproduce the conditions for fragmentation that were previously obtained numerically. In this section, we consider examples for
which no numerical analysis at present exists, namely Higgs
Inflation with a symmetry-breaking potential in both the metric and Palatini formalisms, where the inflaton is oscillating
around the symmetry-breaking minimum of its potential. We
derive the analytical conditions for fragmentation and then
confirm numerically that these conditions are correct.
4 As our aim is to apply our general analytical conditions to a specific model,
we do not discuss the detailed computational steps. Readers may refer to
Refs. [19, 20].

This is easily satisfied since we expect that ξ  1. Therefore,
we expect that the inflaton condensate will fragment in the

in this limit.

inflaton kinetic term in the Einstein frame in the metric case
is modified. The allowed range of ξv

This is simply the fragmentation condition for a minimally
coupled scalar with a broken-symmetry potential. This is expected as in the limit ξv

P
(and so ξϕ2  M2
P
), the nonminimal coupling plays no role in Palatini inflation.
In summary, we find significantly new results for the case
of metric and Palatini Higgs Inflation with a broken-symmetry
potential in the induced gravity limit, and for metric Higgs
Inflation with a broken-symmetry potential in the limit where
v > MP/(
√
6ξ), with all other cases reducing to a conventional
minimally coupled scalar with a symmetry-breaking potential.
In particular, we find that fragmentation will occur for Palatini
Higgs Inflation in the induced gravity limit, but will not occur
for metric Higgs Inflation in this limit.
To our knowledge, there is no numerical study of this particular setup. In order to verify our analytical study, we
perform numerical simulations in 1+3 dimensions by using
the public lattice simulation code LATTICEEASY [25]. We
present results of numerical simulations for the following two
cases:
• Palatini Higgs inflation in the ξv

• Metric and Palatini Higgs inflation with ξv

In both cases, our analytical results predict that fragmentation will occur. Note that, in the second case, the fragmentation conditions are same in both formalisms as in this limit
both models reduce to a minimally coupled scalar with a
symmetry-breaking potential, and there is no difference between the formalisms.
For the numerical simulation, we set Ngrid = 1283

(30m

), and δt = 0.1m

for the first (second) case,
where m ≡

2λv. For both cases, we used the field value at
the end of inflation, Φend = (MP/2
p

(4
p

as the initial condition. The result of the numerical simulation
for the case of ξv
2/M2  1 is shown in Fig. 1. We present
the energy density ρ/hρi = 10, where hρi is the averaged energy density over the lattice. In Fig. 2, we plotted the energy
density ρ/hρi = 10 for the case of ξv
2/M2  1. We see that
the inflaton condensate fragments after inflation ends in both
cases. Our analytical results are thus in agreement with the
numerical analysis.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have derived general analytical conditions
under which the inflaton condensate will fragment for the case
of both symmetric and asymmetric potentials. The robustness
of our results was demonstrated by applying our analytical
fragmentation conditions to a range of models for which the
result is known numerically, including the α-attractor T and
E models, Starobinsky’s R
2 model, and the Palatini R
2 model
with a quadratic potential. In all cases, we find that the analytically predicted condition on the model parameters for fragmentation to occur are in complete agreement with the results
of the numerical analyses.
In addition, we have applied our results to Higgs Inflation
with a broken-symmetry potential in both the metric and Palatini formulations and derived a general condition for fragmentation to occur in these models. We then carried out numerical simulations of these models using LATTICEEASY and
found complete agreement between our analytical predictions
for fragmentation to occur and the results of the numerical
simulations.
The conditions we have derived provide a quick and simple method to check whether any model that can support nontopological soliton solutions (which requires that the scalars
have a mass at the potential minimum and therefore that the
potential is approximately quadratic at the minimum) will undergo fragmentation and to determine the range of model parameters for which this is possible.
The physics of the inflaton condensate fragmentation has
many interesting phenomenological consequences, including
the formation of primordial black holes and gravitational wave
signals. The evolution dynamics generally requires extensive
numerical lattice simulations. We believe that our findings
may serve as a starting point for such numerical analyses.
