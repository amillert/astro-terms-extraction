Given current data, it is not yetpossible to rule out maximal chiral violation, although the case of vanishing correlation with theright helical component is ruled out at about 3.8σ.I. INTRODUCTION As is well known, interactions of left- and right-handedfermions differ and chiral symmetry is broken on the mi-croscopic scales (eg [1 ]). It is then conceivable thatchiral symmetry is also broken in the early Universe,for example by helical couplings between various fieldsof a multi-field model of inflation. Other possible par-ity breaking mechanisms include addition of the Chern-Simons term to the gravitational Lagrangian [2], gravityat a Lifshitz point [3 ] or a chiral gravity with differentNewton's constant for the left- and right-handed gravi-tational waves [4 ]. If such violations were present, theymight be manifest at late times and on large scales, forexample in the cosmic microwave background [2– 5].In [6] we argued that vectors of galaxy angular mo-menta can also serve as a useful probe of such a viola-tion. While amplitudes of galaxy momenta are generallyaffected by late time evolution and hard to predict (eg[7]), their directions *1 are rather closely related to the ini-tial conditions. Indeed, in [6 ] we proposed a vector fieldJ IC quadratic in the initial density and gravitational po-tential (see Eq. (1) below) that correlates well with spinsof dark matter haloes in numerical simulations and canthus serve as a proxy for halo spins. While our simula-tions focused on dark matter haloes, studies [7, 8 ] suggestthat spins of galaxies are tracing spins of their underly-ing dark matter haloes sufficiently well to be practicallyuseful as probes of initial conditions. Currently availablegalaxy survey data confirms, with statistical significanceof about 3σ, that galaxy spins indeed correlate with thevector field J IC [9]. It is thus timely to start searchingfor the primordial chirality violations in the galaxy spindata. *1 For brevity, in what follows we use “spin” to reference only the direction of the angular momentum of a galaxy / halo. With spins of galaxies serving as test probes, in thiswork we search for signs of such violation by comparingcorrelation strengths of the galaxy spins with the left andright helical components of J IC , respectively. We definethese components below. In some sense this is analogousto comparing interaction strengths of the left- and right-handed fermions.From initial conditions obtained by the ELUCID col-laboration in part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)volume [10, 11], we calculate the predicted galactic spinfield J IC and decompose it into its left and right helicalcomponents. We then compare whether the measuredgalaxy spins correlate with these two components withidentical strength. Nonzero difference would signal eithera parity violation in the early Universe, or a systematicin our measurement.This paper is organized as follows: In § II we explainhow to construct the vector field J IC used to predictthe galaxy spins, explain how to separate it into its leftand right helical components and present the correlationmeasures. In § III we introduce the data used in ouranalysis. In § IV we present our results and concludewith a discussion in § V.We denote vectors with bold face letters, their Eu-clidean norm as |v| and label their components withlower case letters v i . ǫ ijk and δ ij represent components ofthe three-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor and Kroneckerdelta, respectively.
To suppressfluctuations on scales too small to affect the halo angu-lar momentum, the initial fields ρ, φ are smoothed with aGaussian kernel with a suitably chosen smoothing scaler. This is indicated by the superscript r. With perfectlyknown initial conditions, the optimal smoothing scale fora particular halo depends on its mass and for a 10 13 M ⊙halo corresponds to about 2 h −1 Mpc. For each halo, thevector field J IC should be evaluated at its Lagrangiancentre of mass.
The initial density field ρ used in this work was ob-tained by the ELUCID collaboration [10 , 11 ].They first pre-processed SDSS data to create a catalogof galaxy groups [12 ] and then determined mass of eachgroup via a luminosity-based abundance matching. Theycorrected for peculiar velocities and only retained groupsin the Northern Galactic Cap, redshift range 0.01 ≤ z ≤0.12 and with masses above 10 12 M ⊙ . The space wasthen tessellated according to which galaxy group was theclosest. Within the resulting sub-volumes, particles wereplaced randomly, in accordance with the expected densityprofile for halo of given mass. This particle distributionrepresents today's density field.In the second step of the reconstruction, ELUCID col-laboration ran a Particle-Mesh (PM) dynamics code re-peatedly in a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo fashion to de-termine the best fit initial conditions. For each randomset of initial conditions, the PM code was used to calcu-late the corresponding value of today's density field. Bycomparing this density field with that determined fromthe SDSS data, it was possible to construct a probabilitymeasure on the space of the initial conditions. Due to in-accuracies of the PM code on small scales, both densityfields were smoothed on a scale of 4Mpc/h before com-parison. Iteratively probing the space of initial conditionsthen allowed ELUCID to find the initial conditions thatbest describe the local galaxy data.
At present, it is possible to obtain the full directionvector of angular momentum for only a limited numberof galaxies as it is necessary to perform an integral fieldspectroscopy and provide additional information.Fortunately, for our purposes of searching for the pri-mordial chirality violation, we do not need to know thefull direction vector J g /|J g |. By focusing only on thecomponents of J g along the line of sight direction r, wecan significantly increase the number of galaxies in oursample.
We base our determination of the sign of J g · r onthe fact that for spiral galaxies the orientation of theangular momentum of the galaxy's gas is closely relatedto the sense of rotation of galaxy's spiral arms (clockwiseor anti-clockwise, ie in the sense of the letters Z orS). To determine the direction of the radial componentof J g , it is thus sufficient to determine whether givengalaxy rotates clockwise or anti-clockwise, with the radialcomponent of galaxy spin aligned resp. anti-aligned withits position vector. This classification is not a perfectdetermination of the galaxy angular momentum, withabout 4% of galaxies having angular momentum that ispointed in the opposite direction than that inferred fromthe orientation of the spiral arms [13], but this effect isnot expected to bias the results.We use a catalog of galaxies classified as “clockwise spi-ral galaxy" and "anticlockwise spiral galaxy" by GalaxyZoo [14], a citizen science project where members of thepublic visually classified properties of almost 9 × 10 5 ob-jects. For each object, summary statistics of the vot-ing results are publicly available and we obtained themthrough CasJobs*2 . We only consider objects classi-fied by at least 80% of votes as either “clockwise spiralgalaxy" or "anti-clockwise spiral galaxy". Our final cat-alog contains 12022 galaxies. We then set the galaxy'sangular momentum to ±r, with sign chosen based ongalaxy's sense of rotation.
We found a mild preference for galaxy spins tocorrelate more strongly with the right helical componentof the vector field J IC built from the initial density fieldaccording to (1), but this preference is not statisticallysignificant for the currently available galaxy sample andinitial condition reconstruction. Given current uncertain-ties, the data is thus consistent with no parity violation.At the same time, our result is at present also consistent with the maximally violating case µ L = 0, µ R = 0, whilethe other maximally violating case µ R = 0, µ L = 0 isexcluded at about 3.8σ
In the nearest future, data from Dark Energy Spectro-scopic Instrument [15] will allow us to notably shrink theerror bars of the µ − measurement. Improving the recon-struction on smaller spatial scales will be especially in-teresting, because simulations suggest that the quadraticformula (1) can lead to correlations up to an order ofmagnitude stronger than what is currently achievable.Additional improvements are then expected from leverag-ing the extensive theoretical and observational knowledgeof the origin of galaxy spins [16– 33 ] to further tighten therelationship between the galaxy spins and initial condi-tions and improve on the simple formula Eq. (1). Anotherinteresting follow-up work would be to pick a particularmodel of chiral breaking and propagate this breaking allthe way to the final galaxy spins, to get an estimate ofhow big an effect one might expect to observe.With sufficient number of galaxy spin measurements,it will be also possible to search for chirality violations inthe galaxy spin field directly, without a need to correlatewith J IC or another similar proxy. For example, one cancompare the power spectra of the left and right helicalcomponents of J g [6 ].While this draft was being finalized, a related work[34] appeared, where an alternative strategy to search forprimordial chirality violations (using four-point functionsof the galaxy density field) was introduced.
