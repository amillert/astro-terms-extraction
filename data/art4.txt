Observational search for primordial chirality violations using galaxy angular momenta
We search for evidence of primordial chirality violation in the galaxy data from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey by comparing how strongly directions of galaxy angular momenta correlate with left and
right helical components of a spin vector field constructed from the initial density perturbations.
Within uncertainties, galaxy spins correlate with these two helical components identically, which is
consistent with Universe without primordial chirality violation. Given current data, it is not yet
possible to rule out maximal chiral violation, although the case of vanishing correlation with the
right helical component is ruled out at about 3.8σ.
I. INTRODUCTION
As is well known, interactions of left- and right-handed
fermions differ and chiral symmetry is broken on the microscopic scales (e.g. [1]). It is then conceivable that
chiral symmetry is also broken in the early Universe,
for example by helical couplings between various fields
of a multi-field model of inflation. Other possible parity breaking mechanisms include addition of the ChernSimons term to the gravitational Lagrangian [2], gravity
at a Lifshitz point [3] or a chiral gravity with different
Newton’s constant for the left- and right-handed gravitational waves [4]. If such violations were present, they
might be manifest at late times and on large scales, for
example in the cosmic microwave background [2–5].
In [6] we argued that vectors of galaxy angular momenta can also serve as a useful probe of such a violation. While amplitudes of galaxy momenta are generally
affected by late time evolution and hard to predict (e.g.
[7]), their directions*1 are rather closely related to the initial conditions. Indeed, in [6] we proposed a vector field
J
IC quadratic in the initial density and gravitational potential (see Eq. (1) below) that correlates well with spins
of dark matter haloes in numerical simulations and can
thus serve as a proxy for halo spins. While our simulations focused on dark matter haloes, studies [7, 8] suggest
that spins of galaxies are tracing spins of their underlying dark matter haloes sufficiently well to be practically
useful as probes of initial conditions. Currently available
galaxy survey data confirms, with statistical significance
of about 3σ, that galaxy spins indeed correlate with the
vector field J
IC [9]. It is thus timely to start searching
for the primordial chirality violations in the galaxy spin
data.
*1 For brevity, in what follows we use “spin” to reference only the
direction of the angular momentum of a galaxy / halo.
With spins of galaxies serving as test probes, in this
work we search for signs of such violation by comparing
correlation strengths of the galaxy spins with the left and
right helical components of J
IC, respectively. We define
these components below. In some sense this is analogous
to comparing interaction strengths of the left- and righthanded fermions.
From initial conditions obtained by the ELUCID collaboration in part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
volume [10, 11], we calculate the predicted galactic spin
field J
IC and decompose it into its left and right helical
components. We then compare whether the measured
galaxy spins correlate with these two components with
identical strength. Nonzero difference would signal either
a parity violation in the early Universe, or a systematic
in our measurement.
This paper is organized as follows: In § II we explain
how to construct the vector field J
IC used to predict
the galaxy spins, explain how to separate it into its left
and right helical components and present the correlation
measures. In § III we introduce the data used in our
analysis. In § IV we present our results and conclude
with a discussion in § V.
We denote vectors with bold face letters, their Euclidean norm as |v| and label their components with
lower case letters vi

the three-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor and Kronecker
delta, respectively.
II. THEORY
In [6] we showed that the vector field J

from the initial density field ρ and the initial gravitational
potential field φ according to

can be used to predict the directions of final angular momenta of dark matter halos in simulations. To suppress
fluctuations on scales too small to affect the halo angular momentum, the initial fields ρ, φ are smoothed with a
Gaussian kernel with a suitably chosen smoothing scale
r. This is indicated by the superscript r. With perfectly
known initial conditions, the optimal smoothing scale for
a particular halo depends on its mass and for a 1013M⊙
halo corresponds to about 2 h
−1 Mpc. For each halo, the
vector field J
IC should be evaluated at its Lagrangian
centre of mass.
In practice, measurements of halo angular momenta
are unavailable and we have to work with angular momenta of galaxies J
g
. Given J
g and values of J
IC at
galaxy Lagrangian positions, we can define the correlation strength
µ =

J
g

J

, (2)
with the average taken over the galaxies. In case of no
relationship between the directions of J
g and J
IC, the
correlation between these two sets of vectors vanishes.
Using SDSS data, we experimentally verified that J
IC
defined in Eq. (1) leads to nonzero µ with a statistical
significance of about 3σ [9].
As explained in greater detail in [6], it is straightforward to split the divergence-free vector field J
IC into its
two helical components J
IC
L
, J
IC
R . This decomposition
can be achieved in the Fourier domain, where the components of the transformed field J˜IC

are combined using
two projection operators P

These projection operators explicitly read

and we defined the unit vector kˆ = k/|k|. The real space
components of J

L/R are then obtained through a backward Fourier transform. Under the parity transformation
the two helical components swap,
J

L ↔ J

Analogously to µ, we can define the correlations with
the left- and right-handed helical components of J
IC as

and their difference,
µ− = µL − µR. (7)
Because of the swap of J
IC
L
and J
IC
R under parity transformation, µ− flips sign. In a universe where the chiral
symmetry is broken at high redshifts and this violation
propagates into galaxy spins, we would detect nonzero
µ−. On the other hand, in standard model we expect
to find µ− consistent with zero. Measurement of µ−
thus amounts to indirectly probing chiral symmetry in
the early Universe and will be the main result of this
work.
To estimate the uncertainties of our measurements, we
repeat the calculations 40 000 times with the variables determining the rotational state of the galaxies (the sign in
(8)) randomly shuffled among the galaxies. As uncertainties of the results we then take the standard deviations
of the ensembles.
III. DATA
In this section we present the observational data used
in this work. We start by describing the initial density
field ρ as reconstructed by the ELUCID collaboration.
We then introduce the data used to determine angular
momenta of galaxies and their positions.
A. Initial conditions
The initial density field ρ used in this work was obtained by the ELUCID collaboration [10, 11].
They first pre-processed SDSS data to create a catalog
of galaxy groups [12] and then determined mass of each
group via a luminosity-based abundance matching. They
corrected for peculiar velocities and only retained groups
in the Northern Galactic Cap, redshift range 0.01 ≤ z ≤
0.12 and with masses above 1012M⊙. The space was
then tessellated according to which galaxy group was the
closest. Within the resulting sub-volumes, particles were
placed randomly, in accordance with the expected density
profile for halo of given mass. This particle distribution
represents today’s density field.
In the second step of the reconstruction, ELUCID collaboration ran a Particle-Mesh (PM) dynamics code repeatedly in a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo fashion to determine the best fit initial conditions. For each random
set of initial conditions, the PM code was used to calculate the corresponding value of today’s density field. By
comparing this density field with that determined from
the SDSS data, it was possible to construct a probability
measure on the space of the initial conditions. Due to inaccuracies of the PM code on small scales, both density
fields were smoothed on a scale of 4 Mpc/h before comparison. Iteratively probing the space of initial conditions
then allowed ELUCID to find the initial conditions that
best describe the local galaxy data.
From these best fit initial conditions, we calculate the
initial gravitational potential φ from the Poisson equation
and use (1) to predict the galaxy spins J
IC.

B. Galaxy Spins
At present, it is possible to obtain the full direction
vector of angular momentum for only a limited number
of galaxies as it is necessary to perform an integral field
spectroscopy and provide additional information.
Fortunately, for our purposes of searching for the primordial chirality violation, we do not need to know the
full direction vector J
g/|J
g
|. By focusing only on the
components of J
g along the line of sight direction rˆ, we
can significantly increase the number of galaxies in our
sample.
When we restrict our attention to only the line of
sight component of the galaxy spin, the vector J
g/|J
g
|
in Eq. (2) and (6) is replaced with
J
g
|Jg|
→ ±rˆ, (8)
with the plus sign used when J
g
· rˆ > 0. Each galaxy is
thus represented by a single bit of information, instead
of a unit vector. Notice that even after this restriction
to radial components, µ− remains sensitive to chirality
violations.
We base our determination of the sign of J
g
· rˆ on
the fact that for spiral galaxies the orientation of the
angular momentum of the galaxy’s gas is closely related
to the sense of rotation of galaxy’s spiral arms (clockwise
or anti-clockwise, i.e. in the sense of the letters Z or
S). To determine the direction of the radial component
of J
g
, it is thus sufficient to determine whether given
galaxy rotates clockwise or anti-clockwise, with the radial
component of galaxy spin aligned resp. anti-aligned with
its position vector. This classification is not a perfect
determination of the galaxy angular momentum, with
about 4% of galaxies having angular momentum that is
pointed in the opposite direction than that inferred from
the orientation of the spiral arms [13], but this effect is
not expected to bias the results.
We use a catalog of galaxies classified as “clockwise spiral galaxy” and “anticlockwise spiral galaxy” by Galaxy
Zoo [14], a citizen science project where members of the
public visually classified properties of almost 9 × 105 objects. For each object, summary statistics of the voting results are publicly available and we obtained them
through CasJobs*2. We only consider objects classified by at least 80% of votes as either “clockwise spiral
galaxy” or “anti-clockwise spiral galaxy”. Our final catalog contains 12022 galaxies. We then set the galaxy’s
angular momentum to ±rˆ, with sign chosen based on
galaxy’s sense of rotation.

C. Galaxy Positions
From CasJobs we also obtain redshift and sky position
for each galaxy in our sample. This allows us to find the
galaxy’s three-dimensional position and use it to interpolate J
IC, making use of an inverse displacement field
of the reconstructed simulation. The line of sight vector
rˆ is also obtained directly from the galaxy position.
IV. RESULTS
To construct the vector field J
IC, we need to choose a
scale r with which to smooth the initial conditions. For
this work, we choose r = 3 h
−1Mpc, as it is the smoothing
scale that for current data leads to the maximal correlation µ in [9].
Using the (anti-)clockwise classifications of the SDSS
galaxies and the initial conditions as determined by the
ELUCID collaboration, we find
µL = (0.41 ± 0.53) × 10−2
(9)
µR = (1.99 ± 0.53) × 10−2
. (10)
The parity-odd variable µ− is then
µ− = (−1.58 ± 0.75) × 10−2
, (11)
formally a 2.1 σ deviation from the value of zero expected
a in parity invariant universe. Notice that the error bars
suggest that J
IC
L /|J
IC
L | and J
IC
R /|J
IC
R | are essentially uncorrelated, which we also checked explicitly.
The parity even combination
µ+ ≡ µL + µR = (2.40 ± 0.74) × 10−2
. (12)
is detected with similar significance as µ,
µ = (1.80 ± 0.53) × 10−2
. (13)
The two are not identical despite
J
IC = J
IC
L + J
IC
R , (14)
as normalization of the vectors in Eq. (2) and (6) is a
nonlinear operation.
V. DISCUSSION
In this work we searched for signature of parity violations in the angular momenta vectors of the SDSS
galaxies. We found a mild preference for galaxy spins to
correlate more strongly with the right helical component
of the vector field J
IC built from the initial density field
according to (1), but this preference is not statistically
significant for the currently available galaxy sample and
initial condition reconstruction. Given current uncertainties, the data is thus consistent with no parity violation.
At the same time, our result is at present also consistent
4
with the maximally violating case µL = 0, µR 6= 0, while
the other maximally violating case µR = 0, µL 6= 0 is
excluded at about 3.8σ.
In principle, there are other parity-odd observables one
can construct beyond µ−. Another possibility would be
for example
∆µ =

J
g
|Jg|
·

J
IC
L − J
IC
R
|JIC|
 , (15)
which differs from µ by only a sign in the numerator (see
(14)). However, this statistic is quite sensitive to galaxies
with small |J
IC|, which leads to a strongly non-Gaussian
distribution and long tails. The reader can contrast this
with µL/R that are both limited to [−1, 1] and no single
galaxy can dominate the µ− statistics, which is the reason
behind our choice.
In the nearest future, data from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument [15] will allow us to notably shrink the
error bars of the µ− measurement. Improving the reconstruction on smaller spatial scales will be especially interesting, because simulations suggest that the quadratic
formula (1) can lead to correlations up to an order of
magnitude stronger than what is currently achievable.
Additional improvements are then expected from leveraging the extensive theoretical and observational knowledge
of the origin of galaxy spins [16–33] to further tighten the
relationship between the galaxy spins and initial conditions and improve on the simple formula Eq. (1). Another
interesting follow-up work would be to pick a particular
model of chiral breaking and propagate this breaking all
the way to the final galaxy spins, to get an estimate of
how big an effect one might expect to observe.
With sufficient number of galaxy spin measurements,
it will be also possible to search for chirality violations in
the galaxy spin field directly, without a need to correlate
with J
IC or another similar proxy. For example, one can
compare the power spectra of the left and right helical
components of J
g
[6].
While this draft was being finalized, a related work
[34] appeared, where an alternative strategy to search for
primordial chirality violations (using four-point functions
of the galaxy density field) was introduced.
