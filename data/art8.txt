The largest temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the
dipole. The simplest interpretation of the dipole is that it is due to our motion with
respect to the rest frame of the CMB. As well as creating the `=1 mode of the CMB
sky, this motion affects all astrophysical observations by modulating and aberrating
sources across the sky. It can be seen in galaxy clustering, and in principle its time
derivative through a dipole-shaped acceleration pattern in quasar positions. Additionally, the dipole modulates the CMB temperature anisotropies with the same frequency
dependence as the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect and so these modulated CMB
anisotropies can be extracted from the tSZ maps produced by Planck. Unfortunately this
measurement cannot determine if the dipole is due to our motion, but it does provide an
independent measure of the dipole and a validation of the y maps. This measurement,
and a description of the first-order terms of the CMB dipole, are outlined here.

1. The CMB Sky from Planck
Planck a was a space-based telescope that measured the microwave sky in nine wavebands, allowing it to capture not only the cosmic microwave background (CMB) but
also several Galactic and extragalactic foreground components. This is most clearly
seen in figure 51 from Ref. 1, which shows the various wavebands of the Planck
satellite and the frequency spectra of the foreground signals across those bands.
One signal of interest to this study is the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect,
which produces so-called y-type distortion signals. This comes from CMB photons
being inverse-Compton scattered, mostly through hot galaxy clusters, which makes
holes (or lowers the flux) at low frequencies and up-scatters (or makes an excess
flux) at high frequencies. This signal allows us to construct a novel and independent
measure of the CMB dipole because temperature anisotropies stemming from the
CMB dipole contaminate the y maps. It can also be used as a valuable test of the
quality of the y maps. We will start in Sec. 2 by setting out relevant notation for
the unboosted CMB sky. Next, in Sec. 3 we will boost the CMB sky, and explore

the relevant terms that arise from that boost in the subsections. Of particular relevance, in Sec. 3.3 we will discuss our measurement of the dipole modulation terms
that mix with the tSZ effect. We will finish in Sec. 4 with a short discussion and
conclusion regarding our work.
2. The Unboosted CMB sky
To derive the connection between the y map and the dipole we will begin by defining
some useful terms regarding the unboosted CMB sky:

These are the dimensionless frequency, the standard Planck blackbody intensity
function, the frequency dependence of the CMB anisotropies and the relative frequency dependence of the tSZ effect or y type distortions, respectively. Thus, to
first order the anisotropies of intensity measured by Planck can be written as
δI(nˆ)

δT(nˆ)

+ y(nˆ)Y (x), (5)
where nˆ is the line of sight direction on the sky and we have only considered the
temperature anisotropies and the y signals here.

The first line has the same frequency dependence as thermal fluctuations and so
appear in typical CMB temperature anisotropy maps. Crucially for our analysis,
the middle line has the same frequency dependence as y-type distortions and thus
describes the signals in the y map. The final line has more obscure frequency
dependence and is not discussed here. Additionally, the direction of the incoming

photons will change from ˆn to ˆn
0
, where ˆn
0 = ˆn − ∇(ˆn · β); this deflection of
the photons by ∇(ˆn · β) is due to aberration, an effect that is not unique to the
microwave sky and occurs for all astronomical observations. We will now discuss
each of these terms in turn.
3.1. The CMB dipole: βµ
In the first line of Eq. 6, the term βµ describes the pure CMB dipole, as discussed
previously. This mainly (or perhaps entirely) comes from our local motion with
respect to the CMB rest frame and it has been previously measured in Refs. 2, 3,
and 4, and most recently in Refs. 5, 6, and 7. Taking the large dipole as being solely
caused by our motion, the velocity is v = (369.82 ± 0.11) km s−1
in the direction
(l, b) = (264.◦021 ± 0.◦011, 48.◦253 ± 0.◦005) 5 and can be easily seen in the CMB
frequency maps, such as in Fig. 1.

` = 1 mode or dipole across the sky. The temperature difference across the sky here is 3.36 mK.
3.2. Aberration and Modulation of the CMB anisotropies:
(1 + 3βµ)δT (ˆn0
)/TCMB
The second term in the first line of Eq. 6 is the dipole aberration and modulation of
the temperature anisotropies of the CMB. The modulation causes the temperature
anisotropies to be brighter in the forwards direction, and dimmer in the reverse
direction. The aberration causes the anisotropies to be more condensed in the
forwards direction, and more stretched out in the reverse direction (effectively the
same as ` = 1 lensing). These two effects can be seen in Fig. 2. This effect was first
measured in Ref. 9 to about 4 σ.

Fig. 2. Here the CMB sky is shown unboosted in (a), with a modulation from a boost of 90 %
the speed of light in (b), and with aberration from a boost of 90 % of the speed of light in (c). In
the case of modulation, the anisotropies are more intense in the forward direction and less so in
the reverse direction, whereas the aberration condenses the anisotropies in the forwards direction
and causes them to be more spread out in the reverse direction.

3.3. Temperature modulation and the tSZ effect:
Y (x)βµδT (ˆn0
)/TCMB
The second line of Eq. 6 shows the dipole-generated signals in the y maps produced
by Planck. The first half is the same modulation and aberration terms as were seen
in the temperature anisotropies; however, the final term is due to the second-order
expansion of the intensity about TCMB and adds a contribution to the y maps from
the temperature anisotropies.
We can look for this signal by cross-correlating a template map, derived from
the CMB temperature data, with a y map. To this end, we use the so-called 2D-ILC
CMB temperature map which was produced by the “Constrained ILC” componentseparation method designed by Ref. 10 to explicitly null out the contribution from
the y-type spectral distortions in the CMB map. We also use the SMICA-NOSZ
temperature map, similarly produced with the express intent of removing the y-type
spectral distortions, and which was generated for the Planck 2018 data release 11
.
Likewise, we use the corresponding 2D-ILC y map, and the Planck MILCA y map,
which explicitly null out the contributions from a (differential) blackbody spectral
distribution in the y map 12,13. If we multiply our CMB map with βµ and crosscorrelate that with our tSZ map, then we can directly probe the dipole modulation.
In Ref. 9 a quadratic estimator was used to determine the dipole aberration and
modulation, in essence using the auto-correlation of the CMB fluctuation temperature maps. In this work we use the fact that we know the true CMB fluctuations
with excellent precision and therefore know the signal that should be present in the
y map. Thus, we fully exploit the angular dependence of the modulation signal and
remove much of the cosmic variance that would be present in the auto-correlation.
In order to implement this idea we define three templates, Bi (with i = 1, 2, 3) as
Bi(nˆ) = βnˆ · mˆ i
δT
T0
(nˆ), (7)
where β = v/c 5
is 1.23357 × 10−3 and mˆ 1, mˆ 2, mˆ 3 are the CMB dipole direction,
an orthogonal direction in the Galactic plane, and the third remaining orthogonal
direction (see Fig. 3). Due to the presence of the CMB dipole, the signal B1 should
be present in the y map and so we can directly cross-correlate B1 with our y map
to pull out the signal. Likewise, the cross-correlation of B2 and B3 with our y map
should give results consistent with noise.
Our y simulations are generated by first computing the power spectra of our
data y maps; specifically we apply the MASTER method using the NaMASTER routine 14 to account for the applied mask 15. Then we generate y maps using this
power-spectrum with the HEALPix 16 routine synfast. We finally apply a Gaussian
smoothing of 50
to model the telescope beam. For each analysis method we estimate the amplitude of the dipole (βˆ
i) in each of the three orthogonal directions.
We apply the same analysis procedure on a suite of 1000 y simulations, generated
with and without the dipolar modulation term.
We use two methods of cross-correlation: the first is performed directly in map-

apply our mask to the templates Bi and the y map.
In the map-space method we then locate all peaks (i.e., local maxima or minima)
of the template map Bi and select a patch of radius 2.◦0 around each peak. For
every peak we obtain an estimate of βˆ
i through the simple operation

where D(p) is the collection of all unmasked pixels in a 2.◦0 radius centred on pixel
p, and p is the position of a peak. Equation 8 is simply a cross-correlation in map
space and by itself offers a highly noisy (and largely unbiased) estimate. We then
combine all individual peak estimates with a set of weights (wp) to give our full
estimate:
βˆ

We choose wp to be proportional to the square of the dipole, and use weights
that are proportional to the square of the Laplacian at the peak 17; this favours
sharply defined peaks over shallow ones. Finally we account for the scan strategy
of the Planck mission by weighting by the 217-GHz hits map 18, denoted H217

We apply the method for each of our simulated y maps, in exactly the same way as

4. Conclusion: Distinguishing Intrinsic and Extrinsic CMB
Dipoles
The frequency-dependent part of the dipolar-modulation signal is agnostic to the
source of the large CMB dipole. Therefore, its measurement is an independent
determination of the CMB dipole. While it may be tempting to use this signal
to distinguish an intrinsic dipole, it has been shown that an intrinsic dipole and a
dipole induced by a velocity boost would in fact have the same dipolar-modulation
signature on the sky 20,21
Due to the existence of the CMB dipole, a tSZ map necessarily contains a contaminating signal that is simply the dipole modulation of the CMB anisotropies.
This occurs because CMB experiments do not directly measure temperature
anisotropies, but instead measure intensity variations that are conventionally converted to temperature variations. This contamination adds power to the tSZ map in
a Y20 pattern, with its axis parallel to the dipole direction. We have measured this
effect and determined a statistically independent value of the CMB dipole, which is
consistent with direct measurements of the dipole. Using a conservative multipole

cut on the y map, the significance of the detection of the dipole modulation signal
is around 5 or 6 σ, depending on the precise choice of data set and analysis method.
The question as to whether an intrinsic dipole could ever be observationally distinguished from an extrinsic dipole (i.e. a Doppler boost) remains an open question.
The terms discussed in Eq. 6 are based on the assumption of a CMB blackbody
spectrum and cannot be used to distinguish the two, as they would naturally arise
whether the CMB dipole is caused by a boost, or if there is for some other reason
a dipole on the sky with the same magnitude and direction.
