IntroductionOver the last century or so, cosmology has progressed from a field that was essen-tially philosophy to a precision science. The current standard cosmological modelis the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model, which mainly consists of a cosmologicalconstant (Λ) or dark energy (DE) component and cold dark matter (CDM) com-ponent, with general relativity (GR) as the assumed theory of gravity. It makespredictions on the smallest and largest scales, that, despite some open questions,are largely verified by a host of observational cosmology experiments.Cosmological and astrophysical surveys in various wavebands, in particular fromthe radio to the far-infrared, are crucial to solve many problems in cosmology andto understand the origin and evolution of the cosmic structures at various scalesthrough cosmic time. The accurate observations of the properties of the cosmicmicrowave background (CMB) began the era of precision cosmology, furtheringour understanding of the early universe and its evolution up to the present timeand beyond. Similarly, the information contained in the radio sky is of increasingrelevance to unravel the complexity of cosmic evolution and to answer a wide rangeof open questions, thanks to the spectacular experimental improvement achieved inthe past years and expected in the future.The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sect . 2, we begin with a preamble tothe so-called tension problem, which occurs when different data are used to deter-mine cosmological parameters. We then discuss the role of fast radio bursts (FRBs)in cosmology to solve the missing baryons problem, followed by the perspectivesrepresented by the analysis of the 21 cm redshifted line from neutral hydrogen (HI).Sect. 3 describes the wealth of scientific information and tools publicly available atthe Planck Legacy Archive (PLA), with its current and future developments, andthe perspectives expected from higher resolution observations at millimeter (mm)and sub-mm wavelengths, in particular for the analysis of the thermal Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich (SZ) effect towards galaxy clusters (GCs), focusing on a forthcomingwell-defined facility instrument. In Sect . 4 we discuss three important cosmologicalresults based on the data from the Planck mission: the implications of the analysis ofthe thermal SZ (tSZ) map, the dipole analysis based on the cross-correlation of CMBanisotropy and tSZ maps, and the constraints on the ratio between the primordialtensor and scalar perturbations. Finally, Sect. 5 is dedicated to future perspectivesand alternative scenarios in cosmology. We consider three specific examples: thestudy of Lorentz invariance violation with the analysis of CMB polarization, thesolution to the dark matter (DM) problem introducing new gravitational degrees offreedom, and the exploitation of the magnification bias with high-z sub-mm galaxiesto constrain a set of cosmological parameters.2. Cosmology in the radio2.1. Cosmology with radio astrophysics and tensions in cosmologyAmongst the successes of modern cosmology, is the remarkable precision in theestimation of the cosmological parameters that describe the contents, geometry andhistory of our universe. Herein also lies the current greatest tension in the data.Indeed, in spite of the increasing precision in observational cosmology, it is possiblewe have lost some accuracy: a number of tensions now appear within our data,tensions that more cosmology experiments do not appear to solve. These tensionsmay require a change in the underlying theory or they may be resolved with novelobservational probes of the large scale picture of the universe. Here we will describean example of the latter, namely, the FRBs, the novel discovery of our century, aspotential instruments for cosmology. Indeed we will highlight more broadly the useof radio astrophysics-encompassing both the use of radio transients and intensitymapping tools, and the potential they hold for groundbreaking cosmology discovery.The Hubble constant, H 0 , is anything but constant across observations at dif-ferent scales (see Ref . 1 for a recent review of most of the data). A brief summaryhowever, is that historically there were two independent measures for H 0 , very farapart in value with measurements of roughly 50 km s −1 Mpc −1 or 100 km s −1 Mpc −1from the early and late universe respectively. However, the error bars on each mea-surement was large enough, that each was within errors of the other and it wasassumed that with improved observations, the error bars would get smaller and thevalues ​​would get closer and converge. Indeed, this appeared to be the case early thiscentury, but every new data set over the last several years has the values ​​divergingwith ever smaller error bars, that critically no longer allow for a simple conver-gence in the value of H 0. Measurements from the early universe, such as Planck,Dark Energy Survey 2, 3 (DES), and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and BigBang nucleosynthesis (BBN) observations, all point to a smaller value of aroundH 0 ≃ 67 km s −1 Mpc −1 and measurements from the late universe, using Cepheidsas distance ladders, or lensing for example, find H 0 ≃ 73 km s −1 Mpc −1 with eachmeasurement having error bars in the range ≃1÷4 km s −1 Mpc −1 . Thus this tension is growing with data rather than resolving.There are longer standing issues with the standard cosmological model, of course,the lack of direct observational evidence for DM which makes up roughly 25% ofthe total energy budget of the universe is of particular concern. No less resolved isthe issue of DE, here making up ∼ 70% of the energy budget of the universe andyet only observed in indirect cosmological experiments with no direct detection andalso no compelling theoretical explanation for why it even exists or why it appearsto be dominating the total energy budget of the universe at a cosmological timewhen we are both possible and here to observe it. Early universe inflation is a keycomponent in the model, solving several open problems such as the flatness andhorizon problems and yet we still have no theory of inflation that fits within anultraviolet complete theory with a natural candidate for the inflaton lacking. Onehopes that these three problems are resolved together with a leap in the theoryspace-yet the obligation remains to continue to search for observational data thatmay yet play a role.Other problems have lingered for very long, such as the missing baryon problem,where even the ∼ 5% of the universe that we know exists is not entirely accountedfor. Indeed adding up all of the observed contributions to the baryons accountsfor only ∼ 70% of the total expected. Roughly 30% are considered missing, andexpected to be somewhere in the warm hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). Indeed,we should say were considered missing, as we discuss below how to find these missingbaryons using the FRBs.2.1.1. Fast radio bursts and their role in cosmologyAs the name suggests, FRBs are very bright (∼ Jy), brief (∼µs to ∼ ms scale)transients, observed in the broad spectrum of the radio. The first was discovered 4in 2007 and ever since the search has been on to discover more and their properties,first through searches in archival data and more recently through purpose builtradio telescopes and arrays to find thousands if not tens of thousands of burstsevery year. Our understanding of the properties of FRBs is still evolving; it appearsthat many but not all repeat, it is not yet known if any of the repeaters repeat ina periodic fashion, and indeed it is likely that ultimately FRBs will fall in severalclasses as has happened with transients historically. Their other properties suchas polarisation, rotation measures etc are all still unknown as the observationsdo not all point to a single pattern and it is not always possible to disentanglehost galaxy effects from propagation effects from intrinsic properties of the bursts.It does appear certain that they are found in host galaxies, and that they lie atcosmological distances, 5 thus making them excellent candidates for cosmology astheir propagation will probe the intergalactic medium (IGM) and thus give us anumber of novel ways to constrain cosmological parameters (see, eg, Refs. 6 –8and references therein). From a theoretical standpoint, the progenitor mechanismdriving FRBs is not yet known though there are strong hints that at least some are driven by magnetars through one of many physical possible mechanisms. A fulldatabase of theories, 9 once outnumbered the observations, but as the amount ofdata grows, the possibilities for theoretical explanations shrinks and so it is likelythat in a few years we will have only a handful of possible contenders remaining,perhaps matching future classes of FRBs.There are a number of ways FRBs can be used as cosmological probes. Here wefocus on a single application. After emission from the source, the photons from theburst travel to the observer through the IGM, and are slowed down differentiallyas a function of their wavelength, λ, or frequency, ν = c/λ, c being the speed oflight. The dispersion measure, M D ≃ / n e dl, where n e is the electron numberdensity and the integral along the line of sight runs from the source to the observer,thus contains cosmological information about the distribution of electrons Indeed,this simple equation combined with precision cosmology constraints from the earlyuniverse allows us to make a prediction for the fraction of baryons in the IGM, 7which can then be experimentally verified. Indeed, the so-called missing baryonproblem is not longer an outstanding problem as the results of Ref. 10 used a handfulof well located FRBs with the observed dispersion measures to show that indeedthe missing baryons are in the IGM as expected, and are playing the predictedrole of dispersing the FRB signal. This longstanding open problem is thus resolvednot due to any great technological or theoretical breakthrough, but simply throughthe use of a few transient observations and an understanding of the contributionsto M D from our own galaxy. This suggests that there is immense and untappedpotential for great discovery with FRBs and that the future is very bright for thisyoung field.2.2. High-redshift universe with redshifted 21 cm lineThe redshifted 21 cm line of HI is one of the most useful probes of the early uni-verse. Several experiments are ongoing and are being planned to detect the signalat high redshift, z. Detection of the signal will help in understanding the first starsin the universe, the formation and evolution of galaxies and also constraining cos-mological parameters. This section summarizes the status of observational effortsand theoretical understanding.The HI evolution can be used to study the thermal and ionization history of theuniverse and also the evolution of the galaxies.11, 12 The very first HI atoms formedduring the so-called'recombination' epoch. The hydrogen remains in the neutralform until the first stars form which can then start ionizing the HI in the IGM,a process known as reionization. This epoch is believed to end around redshiftsz ∼ 5.5 by when almost all the HI in the IGM gets ionized. In the post-reionizationera, the only regions where HI can survive are the high-density regions, eg, theinterstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxies.The evolution of HI can be efficiently tracked by the redshifted 21 cm signalarising from hyperfine transition of the ground state of the atom. The signal is observed, either in emission or absorption, in contrast to the CMB signal using low-frequency radio telescopes. Since the hyperfine transition is forbidden, the signalamplitude turns out to be extremely weak and hence is appreciable only when theHI density is significant. There are broadly three regimes where the detection of the21 cm radiation is being planned: (i) the cosmic dawn when the ultraviolet (UV)and X-ray radiation from the very early galaxies lead to a strong absorption signalaround z ∼ 20; (ii) the epoch of reionization when the heated and ionized IGMleads to an emission signal around z ∼ 15 − 6; and (iii) the post-reionization signalwhen HI in galaxies can be detected either directly or through intensity mapping.Among the different ways to detect the 21 cm signal, perhaps the one that re-quires simplest of the instruments is the signal averaged over large regions of thesky, ie, the global signal. 
This signals believed to be most prominent during thecosmic dawn corresponding to ν ≃ 50 − 100 MHz. The amplitude of the cosmo-logical signal is weak and is buried under other astrophysical signals few orders ofmagnitude stronger, which makes it extremely challenging to separate it out.
An alternate way of detecting the 21 cm signal is through the spatial fluctu-ations. These can, in principle, be useful throughout the cosmic history startingfrom the cosmic dawn to the post-reionization universe. During the cosmic dawn,the fluctuations arise from those in the galactic radiation, while in the epoch reion-ization it is the patchiness in the ionization field that drives the 21 cm fluctuationsignal. In the post-reionization era, the fluctuations in the 21 cm signal essentiallytrace the distribution of galaxies and hence the underlying matter fluctuations.At present, a number of low-frequency interferometers are attempting to de-tect the 21 cm power spectrum (PS) from the epoch of reionization at scales∼ 10h −1 cMpc. Fig. 1 shows the current upper limits (see Ref. 32 for a com-plete compilation of available data). These observational attempts are ably com-plemented by numerical and semi-numerical theoretical models to help interpret thedata. The result from the one such semi-numerical simulation SCRIPTa is shown inFig. 1 for a model of reionization consistent with all other available observations. 25Upcoming facilities like the Square Kilometre Arrayb (SKA) will be able to reacha noise level of ∼ 1 mK (∼ 0.3 mK) within ∼ 100 (1000) hours of observations andHence should constrain reionization models with high statistical significance.3. Observational results and perspectives in the microwaves3.1. The Planck Legacy Archive, present and futurePlanck was an ESA space satellite that measured the microwave sky in nine wave-bands, allowing it to not only capture the CMB to incredible precision, but also toaccurately study a number of astrophysical diffuse emissions and discrete sources(see fig. 51 in Ref . 33 , which shows the various wavebands of the Planck satellite,as well as the foregrounds signals and their frequency spectra across those bands).The PLA hosts and serves over 150 TB of products from Planck that are publiclyavailable via the PLA web interfacec (Fig. 2 ). This interface provides direct accessto the users to a wide variety of products of the Planck Collaborationd through theLow Frequency Instrument (LFI) Data Processing Centre (DPC) in Trieste, Italy,by the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) DPC in Paris, France, and, more recently, ahttps://bitbucket.org/rctirthankar/scriptbhttps://www.skatelescope.orgchttps://pla.esac.esa.intd The Planck Collaboration acknowledges the support of: ESA; CNES, and CNRS/INSU-IN2P3- INP (France); ASI, CNR, and INAF (Italy); NASA and DoE (USA); STFC and UKSA (UK);CSIC, MINECO, JA, and RES (Spain); Tekes, AoF, and CSC (Finland); DLR and MPG (Ger-many); CSA (Canada); DTU Space (Denmark); SER/SSO (Switzerland); RCN (Norway); SFI(Ireland); FCT/MCTES (Portugal); ERC and PRACE (EU).

ThePLA is located at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) near Madrid,Spain, and is maintained by the Data Science and Archives Division personnel.In the last years, four major releases of Planck products have taken place, pro-viding users with the most complete cosmology data set to date.The Planck products can be divided into various categories. First, the time-ordered data, that comes in multiple flavors: raw, semi-calibrated and calibratedscience ready timelines and compressed timelines (called HPRs). Second, the fre-quency maps produced by the DPCs, in most cases for each detector, detectorpair and frequency, and for different combinations of the mission coverage (eg,yearly maps, nominal mission, half-mission, half-ring, full mission, etc); third, themaps of the CMB; and, fourth, the so-called astrophysical component maps thatcontain the diffuse emission from our Galaxy as produced by the dust grains, syn-chrotron emission from spiraling electrons moving along the magnetic field lines,cosmic infrared background (CIB), etc. See Fig. 3, left panel. These CMB andastrophysical maps are derived in the scheme offered by the Hierarchical EqualArea isoLatitude Pixelization of a sphere 34 (HEALPix) using different componentseparation methods, eg, Commander, Spectral Matching Independent ComponentAnalysis (SMICA), Spectral Estimation Via Expectation Maximisation (SEVEM) andGeneralized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC), the four official compo-nent separation methods used to extract the CMB maps in the third Planck Release(PR3). Fifth, source catalogues in various forms, from Galactic and extragalacticcompact source catalogues, available in the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources(PCCS), to galactic cold cores, SZ GCs, high-z lensing candidates, etc (Fig. 3 , rightpanel). Sixth, cosmology products, eg, the Planck likelihood code and associatedfiles, the different flavors of the Planck CMB angular PS as a function of the mul-tipole l (eg, low-l, high-l, temperature-only, temperature and polarization, etc),lensing products and more (Fig. 4 , left panel).Advance Search panels are available to extensively query the PLA database, inaddition to embedded links to the Planck Explanatory Supplement documentation,e ehttps://wiki.cosmos.esa.int/planck-legacy-archive

In 2021 a new releaseof products will take place with a joint reprocessing of LFI+HFI time-ordered datathat includes additional information not used in previous releases. In addition, EUfunded projects reprocessing Planck data, or combining it with other experiments,are expected to the deliver to the PLA higher level data products of interest. ThePLA also offers specialized tools that facilitate the processing of Planck products.These tools are mainly designed to help users who are not familiar with some ofthe particularities of the Planck products, and can be categorized into distinctgroups: map operations including component subtraction, unit conversion, colourcorrection, bandpass transformation, and masking of map-cutouts/full-sky maps;component separation codes, map-making codes and effective beam-averaging. Inaddition, the PLA includes an interface to the latest version of the Planck SkyModel simulation tool (Fig. 4 , right panel), with a simple user interface that allowsusers to simulate the microwave/sub-mm sky with Planck, as well as future CMBexperiments and custom-defined instruments.In the coming years it is planned to continue releasing data products from im-proved reprocessing of Planck data and combining Planck with other experiments.
High angular resolution SZ observations with MISTRALHigh angular resolution mm observations are key to understand a wide varietyof scientific cases. Among the others, the interaction of CMB photons with thehot electron gas in GCs and surrounding medium promises to study GCs and theirdeviation from relaxed behaviour. When the CMB photons scatter off a hot electrongas, for example in GCs, in fact, they undergo inverse Compton scattering which isvisible in the frequency spectrum of the CMB. The resulting distorted spectrum is∆I(x)I 0= yx 4 e x(e x − 1) 2(x cothx2 −4)= yg(x),(1)where I 0 = (2h P /c 2 )(k B T CMB /h P ) 3 , T CMB is the CMB temperature, x =h P ν/(k B T CMB ) is the dimensionless frequency, and y = / n e σ T k B T e /(m e c 2 )dl isthe Comptonization parameter, the integral along the line of sight of the electrondensity n e multiplied by the electron temperature T e ; σ T is cross-section of Thom-son scattering, k B and h P are the Boltzmann and Planck constants. This is thetSZ effect 35, 36 and it can be used to study both relaxed and non-relaxed GCs. Infact, GCs can experience a wide variety of situation including collisions, merging,and non-relaxed situation. In addition, not only GCs can host relativistic electrons.Hydrodynamical simulations 37, 38 suggested that GCs occupy the knots of the socalled cosmic web (CW) and WHIM is disposed connecting GCs forming filamentsthat could be seen through the SZ effect itself.An instrument being prepared for such scientific cases is the MIllimeter Sardiniaradio Telescope Receiver based on Array of Lumped elements kids 39 (MISTRAL),to be fielded at the 64m Sardinia Radio Telescopef (SRT). MISTRAL will use anarray of 408 kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) with a field of view of 4 and anangular resolution of ∼ 12. It is a cryogenic instrument with detectors cooled downat 270mK and with frequency domain multiplexing (FDM), Reconfigurable OpenArchitecture Computing Hardware 2 (ROACH2) based read-out.MISTRAL is a facility instrument to be installed at the SRT in 2022. It operatesin an atmospheric window in the frequency range 78÷103GHz, namely W-band,that is interesting for a number of scientific reasons, and most importantly it pro-vides low optical depth and allows high efficiency observations. It will be installedin the Gregorian room of the SRT (Fig. 5) .MISTRAL consists of a cryostat, being constructed by Queen Mary College(QMC) Instruments,g with a Pulse Tube (PT) cryocooler, an He-10 sorption re-frigerator, custom optics and detectors. In order to have the PT heads as closeas possible to vertical position during observations, we have positioned the headwith an inclination of 57.5 ◦ with respect to the focal plane. This allows obser-vation elevations in the range of 32.5 ◦ ÷82.5 ◦ with no degradation of the thermalperformance. fhttp://www.srt.inaf.itghttp://www.terahertz.co.uk/qmc-instruments-ltd
Fig. 5. Left: SRT Turret with MISTRAL installed. Right: a cut of MISTRAL cryostat highlight-ing the main parts. Acknowledgement: MISTRAL Collaboration. The optical design of MISTRAL includes a set of radiation quasi-optical filters,anchored at the different thermal stages of the cryostat, an Anti Reflection Coated(ARC) Ultra High Molecular Weight (UHMW) polyetilene window, and two Siliconlenses able to image the Gregorian Focus on the array of detectors. Detectors arecoupled to radiation through open space (filled array) so cryogenic cold stop, placedin between the two lenses, is needed.MISTRAL will take advantage of the high sensitivity and capability of FDMof KIDs cryogenic detectors. KIDs are superconductive detectors where mm radia-tion with higher energy with respect to the Cooper pair binding energy, can breakCooper pairs producing a change in the population densities and thus in the kineticinductance. In fact, the inductance L of a thin superconductor is dominated bythe kinetic inductance L k , which depends on the Cooper pair density. The detec-tor array is composed of 408 KIDs detectors. They are 3mm × 3 mm each and arearranged on an equilateral triangle every 4.2mm on a 4inches silicon wafer. Theysample the focal plane with a full width half maximum (FWHM) angular spacingof 10.6 lower the each pixel angular resolution. The ROACH2 based FDM, orig-inally developed for the Osservatorio nel Lontano Infrarosso Montato su PalloneOrientabileh (OLIMPO) experiment, 40, 41 will be used.MISTRAL will be a facility instrument: it will be open to the scientific com-munity to decide what kind of scientific output it can achieve and propose theobservations to the Time Allocation Committee of the SRT. Nevertheless, we willlist some scientific cases below, including those we find most interesting.Protoplanetary discs mm measurements in star forming regions allow to breakthe degeneracy present in infrared (IR) measurements due to the optically thicknature of the hot inner disc. 42 Observations of star formation in molecular cloudswith high enough angular resolution allow to distinguish starless cores with respectto those hosting protostars. 43 Continuum resolved galaxies observations can give h Far Infrared Observatory Mounted on Orientable Balloon. See http://olimpo.roma1.infn.it. information about morphology and radial profiles, eg, gas column profiles, dusttemperature profiles. 44 Spatially resolved high-z radio galaxies can provide infor-mation about cold dust re-emission.45What is probably the most impacting expected result of MISTRAL is the pos-sibility to observe and resolve the SZ effect through GCs and surrounding medium.With respect to moderate to low angular resolution observations, high (≃ 10) etec-tions can investigate non relaxed GCs, study merging GCs, understanding the selfsimilarities of GCs, their identical appearance regardless of their mass or distance.Study the pressure profiles and understand the active galactic nuclei (AGN) feed-back expected in some environments. Often GCs are assumed to be spherical andisothermal. Nevertheless, they interact, collide and merge, bringing to importantdegeneracies and deviation from specific models. High angular resolution SZ mea-surements allow to disentangle between models and to identify the most appropriateones. Even relaxed GCs experience pressure fluctuations and compressions of theintra cluster medium which would be interesting to study.GCs experience hierarchical growth through mergers. Pre-mergers GCs shouldbe connected through the CW and simulations endorse this.37, 38 WHIM are ex-pected to be distributed as over-densities in filamentary structures between GCs:high angular resolution SZ measurements can detect WHIM better than X-ray un-der low density circumstances. This is probably the most challenging and mostrewarding of the achievements that an experiment like MISTRAL can achieve.4. Planck cosmological implications4.1. New Planck thermal SZ map and its cosmological analysisThe ΛCDM model provides a wonderful fit to many cosmological data. How-ever, a slight discrepancy was found in the latest data analyses between the CMBanisotropies (z ∼ 1100) and other cosmological probes at low (z ∼ 0 ÷ 1) red-shift, z, for the S 8 (≡ σ 8 (Ω M /0.3) 0.5 ) cosmological parameter representing the am-plitude of the structure growth in the universe; here Ω M and σ 8 are the usualnon-relativistic matter density parameter and the density contrast on a scale of 8[H 0 /(100 km s −1 Mpc −1 )] −1 Mpc.For example, the S 8 value was precisely measured to be S 8 = 0.830±0.013 withthe Planck CMB observation. 46 However, a lower value of S 8 ∼ 0.77 ± 0.03 wasmeasured using the population of GCs detected by Planck at low-z 47, 48 (z <0.6),thus called “S 8 tension”. Furthermore, other low-z observations with gravitationallensing by the Kilo-Degree Survey 49 (KiDS) and DES experiments also found lowerS 8 values. These results indicate that the cosmic structure growth is slower thanthe prediction based on the CMB measurement and may demand modifications tothe standard cosmological model to explain all these measurements.One of the most interesting signals extensively studied with Planck is the tSZeffect, which produces what are known as y distortions, or y type signals. Theseprimarily come from CMB photons being inverse-Compton scattered through hot

GCs (see Sect. 3.2) , which makes holes, or lowers the flux of low frequency photonsand up scatters, or makes an excess flux of high frequency photons.The tSZ signal is subdominant relative to the CMB and other foreground emis-sions in the Planck bands. Thus a tailored component separation algorithm isrequired to reconstruct the tSZ map. We adopted the Modified Internal LinearCombination Algorithm 51 (MILCA) used for the Planck y-map reconstruction in2015 and applied it to the 100 to 857 GHz frequency channel maps (see Sect. 3.1 )from the fourth Planck Release (PR4).The Planck PR4 data implemented several improvements from the previousversion: the usage of foreground polarization priors during the calibration stage tobreak scanning-induced degeneracies, the correction of bandpass mismatch at allfrequencies, the inclusion of 8% of data collected during repointing maneuvers, etc.With these improvements we produced a new y-map with smaller noises (by ∼7%)and reduced strips than the previous version released in 2015 (Fig. 6, top panels).We also reconstructed two y-maps from the first and last halves of the data for a cosmological analysis and considered a cross-angular PS between these y-maps toavoid the bias induced by the noise in the auto-angular PS (see Ref. 52 for moredetails). This tSZ cross-PS is affected by residual foreground emissions from radioand IR point sources and CIB emission. Thus we fitted our measurement with thecosmology-dependent tSZ model, including the radio and IR point source models,53the CIB model 54 and the noise (Fig. 6, left bottom panel).The cosmological analysis of the tSZ cross-PS allowed us to set constraintson cosmological parameters, mainly of the S 8 parameter. We obtained S 8 =0.764 +0.015 −0.018 (statistical) +0.031 −0.016 (systematic), in which the systematic uncertainty in-cludes the contributions from the mass bias and pressure profile model. Our ob-tained S 8 value is fully consistent with recent weak lensing results from KiDS andDES. It is also consistent with the Planck CMB's result46 within 2σ, while it isslightly lower by ∼1.7σ (Fig. 6, right bottom panel).4.2. The CMB dipole and the thermal SZ effect: Eppur Si MuoveThe largest temperature anisotropy in the CMB is the dipole pattern at l = 1. Thesimplest interpretation of the dipole is that it is due to our motion with respect to therest frame of the CMB (with debate over the possibility of alternative explanations),and is measured to be β = v/c = (1.23357 ± 0.00036) × 10 −3 in the direction of theconstellation Crater, (l, b) = (264.021 ◦ ± 0.011 ◦ , 48.253 ◦ ± 0.005 ◦ ), see Ref. 55. Aswell as creating the l=1 mode of the CMB sky, this motion affects all astrophysicalobservations by modulating and aberrating sources across the sky, such as the CMBtemperature anisotropies. These and other effects will be discussed.As discussed above, an accurate mapping of the tSZ signal on the sky has beenachieved with the Planck satellite. This allows us to construct a novel and in-dependent measure of the CMB dipole because the y maps are contaminated bytemperature anisotropies stemming from the CMB dipole. This is also valuable asa test of the quality of the y maps.
The second line of Eq. (6 ) shows the signals in the y maps produced by Planck.The first half is the same boost as was seen in the temperature anisotropies, how-ever, the final term is due to the second-order expansion of the intensity aboutT CMB and adds a contribution to the y maps from the temperature anisotropies.We measured this signal in Ref. 57 to 6σ by cross-correlating the expected mod-ulated temperature map with the y maps. We confirmed the dipole direction bycross-correlating the temperature maps modulated in two additional perpendiculardirections. To test consistency and rule out different systematics, we used the Inter-nal Linear Combination (ILC) in two dimensions, 2D-ILC, and MILCA y-maps, thetemperature anisotropies from both 2D-ILC and SMICA, and finally both a harmonicspace analysis and a map space analysis.The question as to whether an intrinsic dipole could be observationally distin-guished from an extrinsic dipole remains an open question. The terms discussed inEq. (6 ) are based on the assumption of a CMB blackbody spectrum i and cannot beused to distinguish the two, as they would naturally arise whether the CMB dipolewere caused by a boost, or if there were simply a dipole in the sky with the samemagnitude and direction. i See instead Ref. 59 for a study exploiting the relaxation of the blackbody assumption and refer- ences to other methods.
Planck constraints on the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratioDiscovering the stochastic field of gravitational waves generated during the earlyphases of the universe is one of the most ambitious goals of modern cosmology. Var-ious models of inflation predict cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctua-tions 60– 66 in terms of tensor component (gravitational waves) and scalar component(density variations). Inflationary gravitational waves entering the horizon since re-combination epoch generate a tensor component contributing to temperature (T),polarization (E and B modes) and cross-correlation TE angular PS, C X l where Xstands for a given modej, of CMB anisotropy, 67– 69 in particular at large angularscale (or at low multipoles, l <∼ 150, where l ∼ 180 ◦ /θ approximately relates l to the angular scale θ). C X l is typically represented in terms of D Xl = l(l+1)C Xl /(2π), which is nearly flat at low multipoles for X = T, although a power suppression atvery large scales, first observed by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) anthen confirmed by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and by thePlanck satellite, is predicted in several inflationary models possibly in connectionwith universe geometry and topology.While the E and TE modes contain both scalar and tensor signals mainly comingfrom the epochs of recombination and reionization, the model does not predictprimordial scalar fluctuations in the B-mode. The detection of the primordial B-mode then constitutes a direct way to unravel tensor perturbations from the earlyuniverse, and the efforts to measure of the ratio, r, between the amplitudes ofprimordial tensor and scalar perturbations is the main scientific aim of many on-going and future CMB projects. When CMB photons pass through gravitationalpotentials produced by cosmic structures, part of the E-mode power is transformedto B-mode power, the so-called lensing B-mode. This signal, already detected bya number of ground-based observatories and by Planck, is particularly importantat small angular scale 70 (l >∼ 150), but it may mask the primordial B-mode also atintermediate angular scale and, for low r, even at large angular scale.Assuming the spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations are described by purepower-laws, P s (k) = A s (k/k 0 ) n s −1 , P t (k) = A t (k/k 0 ) n t , they are fully defined bythe two amplitude parameters A s ,A t and by the so-called (comoving wavenumber)pivot scale k 0 , the definition of r = A t /A s being then related to the choice of k 0 .Among the various choices adopted in the literature, k 0 = 0.05 Mpc −1 approxi-mately corresponds to the middle of the logarithmic range of k probed by Planck.For historical reasons, a scale-invariant spectrum corresponds to n s = 1 or to n t = 0for scalar or tensor perturbations, respectively.The multipole range 2 <∼ l <∼ 150 is the most advantageous to directly extractr from B-mode analyses. According to theoretical predictions, the primordial D B l is close to the maximum at 50 <∼ l <∼ 150, the region of the so-called recombina- j For simplicity, we use here two letters only for cross modes. tion bump (i); at large scale, l <∼ 10, D Bl exhibits a pronounced bump generated at late epochs by the reionization process (ii); at 10 <∼ l <∼ 50, log(D Bl ) increases almost linearly with log(l) (iii). Exploiting higher l's is of particular relevancefor a very accurate treatment (delensing) of lensing B-mode. C B l increases almost linearly with r, the reionization bump features depending on r and on the detailsof the reionization process, which is parametrized to first approximation by thecorresponding Thomson optical depth, τ. In general, the detection of primordialB-modes requires exquisite experimental sensitivity and accuracy as well as veryprecise treatment of the polarized foreground emissions (see, eg, Ref. 71) , particu-larly for low values ​​of r, which is why a primordial B-mode tensor signal has not yetbeen detected. On the other hand, recent CMB projects set significant upper limitsto r. The great sensitivity achievable by ground-based experiments on selected skyareas has been used to strongly constrain (i), the current tightest B-mode limitson r from these scales coming from the Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalac-tic Polarization (BICEP)/Keck measurements 72 (BK15), while the Planck all-skysurvey allows to constrain (i), (ii) and (iii). In particular, Ref . 73 presents B-modelimits on r from Planck data at l <∼ 30.A recent reanalysis of Planck data alone and in combination with BK15 (seeRef. 74 for a previous joint analysis) has been performed in Ref. 75 exploiting thewhole multipole range 2 ≤ l ≤ 150. In this study, the Planck PR4 data (see Sect.3.1 ) were adopted, where the NPIPE 76 processing pipeline was used to create cal-ibrated frequency maps in temperature and polarization from LFI and HFI data,providing several improvements in noise and systematics levels in both frequencyand component-separated maps. Various sky masks were considered in order toretain different sky fractions (from 30% to 70%) and to test the impact of datatreatment. In polarization, the CMB sky was separated from foregrounds apply-ing the Commander 77 code to a model with three components, namely the CMB,synchrotron, and thermal dust emission, starting from the PLA PR4 maps butdowngraded from N side = 2048 to N side = 16 and to N side = 1024 respectively forthe analysis at 2 ≤ l ≤ 35 and at 35 ≤ l ≤ 150. An updated version of the LOw-lLIkelihood on POlarised Power-spectra (LoLLiPoP) code previously employed bythe Planck Collaboration in the reionization analysis 78 was used to derive the like-lihood from cross-power spectra for the CMB maps reprocessed as outlined above.Here, cross denotes that the angular PS is extracted analyzing different sets of de-tectors: indeed, for these cross-power spectra the bias is zero when the noise isuncorrelated between maps. Unbiased estimates of the angular PS were derivedusing an extension of the quadratic maximum likelihood estimator and a classicalpseudo-C l estimator at 2 ≤ l ≤ 35 and at 35 ≤ l ≤ 150, respectively. The C lcovariance is deduced from end-to-end simulations and thus includes CMB samplevariance, statistical noise, residuals from systematics, uncertainties from foregroundsubtraction, and correlations generated by masking. These uncertainties are prop-agated through the likelihood up to the level of cosmological parameters.
Applying this analysis to the B-mode alone, fixing the other cosmological pa-rameters to the fiducial ΛCDM spectrum of Planck 2018 results, and consideringthe cleanest 50% fraction of the sky, the values ​​of r (for k 0 = 0.05 Mpc −1 ) re-trieved from the posterior distribution analysis at 2 ≤ l ≤ 35 (that includes thereionization bump) or at 35 ≤ l ≤ 150 (that includes the recombination bump) arer 0.05 = −0.014 +0.108 −0.111 or r 0.05 = +0.069 +0.114 −0.113 , respectively. The two multipole win-dows contribute almost equally to the overall Planck sensitivity to r. Combiningthem gives r 0.05 = 0.033±0.069, while setting also a positive value of r as a physicalprior implies r 0.05 <0.158 at 95% CL.A tighter result, r 0.05 = −0.031±0.046, and a stronger constraint, r 0.05 <0.069at 95% CL, slightly improving the BK15 95% CL limit r 0.05 <0.072, is derivedapplying the same method but jointly considering the three polarization modes B,E and EB.kThese results on r do not depend significantly on the choice of other ΛCDMcosmological parameters. In particular, the constraints on r are unchanged when r isretrieved together with τ: considering all polarization modes r 0.05 = −0.015±0.045and τ = 0.0577 ± 0.0056, while considering only the B-mode r 0.05 = 0.025 ± 0.064and τ is undetermined because of the noise.The Planck temperature data are crucial to determine the other ΛCDM pa-rameters and then, when combined with polarization data, to exhaustively verifyif the limits on r depend on the other parameters. Furthermore, although Plancktemperature data, when considered alone, are found to be about two times less sen-sitive than Planck polarization data in constraining r, the tensor contribution totemperature fluctuations allows to further tight the constraints on r derived frompolarization data alone. In fact, including also Planck temperature data in theanalysis using the Planck public low-l temperature-only likelihood based on thePR3 CMB map recovered from the Commander and the High-l Likelihood on Po-larised Power-spectra (HiLLiPoP) at l> 30, and marginalizing over the nuisanceand the other ΛCDM cosmological parameters, from the posterior distribution for rthe authors 75 derive the currently most stringent upper limit based on Planck dataalone: ​​r 0.05 <0.056 at 95% CL.Finally, in Ref. 75 the Planck temperature and polarization data analyzed assummarized above have been combined with the BK15 data, assuming their mutualindependence, ie simply multiplying their likelihood distributions, as justifiedgiven their so different sky coverage, obtaining r 0.05 <0.044 at 95% CL whichcurrently represents the most stringent upper limit. k The primordial EB is expected to be null in the ΛCDM model. On the other hand, special rotation effects of the polarization field (such as birefringence) can produce some EB signal.
Future and alternative perspectives5.1. Lorentz invariance violation and CMB polarizationThe standard model of cosmology can explain the CMB radiation from the recombi-nation epoch till today. As discussed above, it predicts the existence of some degreesof linear polarization known as E-modes and B-modes (see also Refs. 79 –81). Thelinear polarization can be induced to the CMB by means of Compton scatteringof CMB photons and cosmic electrons in presence of cosmological perturbations.However, the circular polarization for the CMB is a rare process in the standardmodel of cosmology, so that observation of any level of circular polarization can bea hint for the existence of new physics. The circular polarization for the CMB canbe generated through Faraday conversion in which linear polarized light propagatesthrough a medium resulting in different indexes of refraction along the two trans-verse axes. 82, 83 Moreover, the CMB photons scattering from vector or fermionicDM can lead to circular polarization of the CMB. 84, 85 Furthermore, circular po-larization for the CMB can be induced by electron-photon Compton scattering inpresence of a background field such as a magnetic field 82 or non-commutativity inspace and time. 83, 86In this study, we would like to explore the effects of Lorentz invariance violation(LIV) as a new background in the generation of circular polarization (see Ref. 87for details). To do that we assume the CMB photon and cosmic electron scatterwhile the particle Lorentz symmetry is violated. To evaluate the LIV effect inthe Compton scattering, we focus on an effective field theory approach known asstandard model extension (SME). The minimal version of the SME contains everygauge invariant and observer-covariant operator, made by all the standard model(SM) fields which violate Lorentz invariance specified with new couplings. 88 Inthe SME, LIV is considered in a coordinate that the speed of light is constantc in all frames.

Magnification bias is due to gravitational lensing and consists in the apparent excessin the number of high-z sources (the lenses sources) close to the position of low-zgalaxies (the lenses). In fact, the gravitational lensing deflects the light rays ofhigh-z sources causing the stretching of the apparent sky area in the region affectedby the lensing. This also causes a boost in the flux density of the high-z sources,making them more likely to be detected above a given instrument flux densitylimit (see, eg, Ref . 110). The magnification bias can be measured through thecross-correlation between the low and high-z objects. Given two source sampleswith non-overlapping redshift distributions, the excess signal when computing theircross-correlation with respect to the random case is due to the magnification bias.Being such signal related to lensing and thus to cosmological distances and thegalaxy halo characteristics, it can be used to constrain cosmological parameters.In order to get the best cross-correlation measurements, at the moment theoptimal choice is to use as high-z sources (background samples) the high-z sub-mmgalaxies (SMGs) first of all because of their steep number counts, shown with recentobservations by the Herschel Space Observatory 111 and the South Pole Telescope 112(SPT) strengthening their magnification. Moreover, the SMGs are faint in theoptical which means that they do not get confused with the foreground lens sample,being such sample invisible at sub-mm wavelength. Lastly, the SMGs redshift areusually above z> 1 so that their selection as background sample ensures no overlapwith the foreground objects. In fact, due to their extreme magnification bias, Dunneet al. (Ref. 113 ) make a serendipitous direct observation of high-z SMGs. Whileperforming a study of gas tracers with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeterArray (ALMA) observation of galaxies targeting a statistically complete sample oftwelve galaxies selected at 250 µm with z = 0.35, magnified SMGs appears aroundthe position of half of the
