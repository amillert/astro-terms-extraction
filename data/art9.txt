ABSTRACT
The current data acquisition rate of astronomical transient surveys and the promise for significantly
higher rates during in the next decade necessitate the development of novel approaches to analyze
astronomical data sets and promptly detect objects of interest. The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF)
program is a survey focused on the identification of fast evolving transients, such as fast radio bursts,
gamma-ray bursts, and supernova shock breakouts. It employs a multi-frequency simultaneous coverage
of the same part of the sky over several orders of magnitude. Using the Dark Energy Camera mounted
on the 4-meter Blanco telescope, DWF captures a 20 second g-band exposure every minute, at a
typical seeing of ∼ 1
00 and an airmass of ∼ 1.5. These optical data are collected simultaneously with
observations conducted over the entire electromagnetic spectrum – from radio to γ-rays – as well as
cosmic ray observations. In this paper, we present a novel real-time light curve analysis algorithm,
designed to detect transients in the DWF optical data; this algorithm functions independently from,
or in conjunction with, image subtraction. We present a sample of fast transients detected by our
algorithm, as well as a false-positive analysis. Our algorithm is customizable and can be tuned to be
sensitive to transients evolving over different timescales and flux ranges.
1. INTRODUCTION
The field of transient astronomy is booming, with several successful completed, ongoing, and planned optical surveys
that will come online in the coming years, specifically designed to find transient phenomena. Among the former, the
Palomar Transient Factory/Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (PTF/iPTF, Rau et al. 2009; Law et al. 2009)
the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS, Magnier et al. 2013), the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS, Wolf et al. 2016) The Supernova Survey, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019;
Graham et al. 2019) the Dark Energy Survey (DES, Dark Energy Survey Collaboration et al. 2016) the All Sky
Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Kochanek et al. 2017) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS, Ricker et al. 2015) have provided a census of a large variety of supernovae (SNe), tidal-disruption events, and
exo-planet confirmations. In the latter category, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Telescope
will push our understanding of the transient sky towards deeper limits and longer wavelengths. An overview of the
field of view, depth, and cadence of these surveys can be found in Table 1. In conjunction with some of these optical
surveys, gravitational wave (GW) detectors like the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory
(aLIGO, LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2015) and Virgo (Acernese et al. 2015), and neutrino detectors such as

IceCube (IceCube Collaboration 2005) and the Baksan Neutrino Observatory (Kuzminov 2012) have ushered us in a
new era of multi-messenger transient astronomy.
We expect that the discovery of new and exciting transient phenomena will continue at higher pace thanks to the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory/Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST, Ivezić et al. 2019): the telescope is being
constructed in Cerro Pachón, Chile (with a planned first light date in 2022 before commencing operations in 2023),
and aims to image the sky in Wide, Fast, Deep mode at a depth of g ∼ 24 every 3 days (LSST Science Collaboration
et al. 2017). The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope/Wide-field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST, Spergel et al. 2015)
will cover an area of 9 square degrees at an average depth of J ∼ 25 with a cadence of 5 days in a proposed medium
depth supernova survey when it is launched on its scheduled date in 2025 (Akeson et al. 2019; Hounsell et al. 2018).
We summarize the characteristics of these planned instruments in Table 1.
1.1. Current Survey Results
In this section we briefly summarize some of the seminal discoveries that the next-generation of surveys will look to
build upon. For example, Pan-STARRS results include the outburst from a SN progenitor one year before its explosion
(Fraser et al. 2013), a lack of super-luminous SNe with light-curves compatible with pair-instability models (Nicholl
et al. 2013), and the first interstellar asteroid detection (de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2017). Similarly,
the most recent SDSS survey results include the detection of baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements (Alam et al.
2017), evidence for the Epoch of Reionization around z ∼ 6 (Becker et al. 2001), high redshift (z > 5.6) quasars
(Fan et al. 2001), and indirect dark matter detection via weak-lensing (Fischer et al. 2000). And finally, in the recent
years PTF/iPTF/ZTF have further enhanced our knowledge on tidal disruptions events (TDEs, Hung et al. 2018),
gamma-ray burst (GRB) orphan afterglows (Singer et al. 2013), and hosts of novel SNe (Arcavi et al. 2010; Goobar
et al. 2017; Kasliwal et al. 2010; Ofek et al. 2010; Horesh et al. 2012; Cao et al. 2013; Ofek et al. 2013).
Due to the design of these facilities and their observational strategies, there is still a lack of discoveries of fast (. 1
hour) and faint (mg & 21) transients (see Figure 3 right panel). There are several science cases that benefit from the fast
identification (and potential classification) of rapidly varying transients with simultaneous observations spanning the
electromagnetic spectrum. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a class of objects characterized by either single, or repeating
radio bursts evolving on sub-second time scales; finding emission at frequencies other than radio is important toward
understanding the progenitors and ignition mechanism(s) for these events. The first emission other than radio observed
to accompany an FRB was recently detected from a magnetar in the Milky Way at X-ray frequencies; although the
bursts are weaker in the radio than extragalactic FRBs, this event suggests that magnetars may be the progenitors of
at least some FRBs (Andersen et al. 2020; Bochenek et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2020).

Also, due to a lack of sufficient early time observations of SNe, the shock breakout mechanism for type Ia SNe
and the ignition mechanisms for core-collapse SNe (CC-SNe) are still not well understood. Type Ia SNe are critical
for determining cosmological distance scales, and are used to measure the accelerated expansion of the universe
(Riess et al. 1998). Despite their use as standard candles, the shock breakout mechanism for type Ia SNe is not
conclusively understood (Nomoto 1982). Identification and follow-up of a type Ia SNe within the first day can lead to
an understanding of the shock breakout mechanism including the detection of a cooling tail, indicative of a delayed
detonation transition (Piro et al. 2010). More importantly, the nature and progenitors of SNe Ia is unclear. The
detection of UV/optical bursts from SNe Ia ejecta colliding with a companion star (e.g., Cao et al. 2015) helps
to secure the single-degenerate progenitor model for some fraction of events; these detections must occur on short
timescales. A better understanding of type Ia SNe could be the key towards resolving the more than 3σ discrepancy
between measurements of the Hubble Constant using the cosmic microwave background (e.g. by Planck, Hinshaw
et al. 2013; Planck Collaboration et al. 2020) and measurements made using the cosmic distance ladder method (e.g.,
Riess et al. 1998, 2016), on which type Ia SNe are a vital rung.
The study of CC-SNe is important in understanding the ends of the life cycles of massive stars and is believed to
be one of the main drivers of nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron (Arnett & Clayton 1970). Early detection
and follow-up of CC-SNe can distinguish between various theorized ignition mechanisms such as: magneto-rotational
instabilities (Akiyama et al. 2003), standing accretion shocks (Blondin et al. 2003), acoustic shocks (Burrows et al.
2007), and QCD phase transitions (Sagert et al. 2009).
The first GRB orphan afterglow may have been detected in the radio (Law et al. 2018), but was discovered at
such a late time after its prompt emission, that deep optical follow ups resulted in only upper limits. Searches are
also being performed by ZTF (Andreoni et al. 2020a) for orphan afterglows and kilonovae. One candidate orphan
afterglow (Coughlin et al. 2020) was later associated with prompt γ- and X-ray emission from GRB 201103B (Svinkin
et al. 2020); the optical component was reported first by ZTF, instilling confidence in the veracity of their method
in detecting and identifying orphan afterglows. The study of orphan afterglows would allow us to calculate GRB jet
angles, as well as the true GRB rate (Rhoads 1997).
Although we have made many discoveries with surveys such as PTF, ZTF, and ASAS-SN, and plan on continued
success with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Roman Space Telescope, there is a void in the parameter
space for fast, faint transients that remains unfilled. Our understanding of GRB orphan afterglows, short GRBs, FRBs,
SN ignition mechanisms and shock-breakouts, and electro-magnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events can be
greatly enhanced by detecting these transients in real-time across several segments of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Due to the rarity of these events, the use of wide-field facilities is needed.

1.2. Challenges of Detecting and Studying Fast Transients
The challenges of “big-data” in astronomy have been well documented (e.g., Feigelson & Babu 2012; Zhang & Zhao
2015; Kremer et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2015). As seen in Table 1, the cadence of many optical transient surveys
allows for longer processing times, but could limit the speed with which astronomers detect transient phenomena,
with potential delays of several days between the start of an event and its detection. The Deeper, Wider, Faster
program offers a different approach to other optical surveys, and presents new challenges to analyze incoming data
in “real-time”. The real-time, fast processing by DWF (described in Section 2.1) is by no means ideal or optimal;
the lossy compression adds artifacts and the fast data processing is much poorer than normal processing, creating
additional artifacts and poorer astrometry and alignments, which can yield poorer subtractions. This sub-optimal
fast processing is necessary, however, in order to identify events and trigger follow-up before sources fade. Detailed
follow-up of these events, ideally spectra, can shed light on the early phases of SNe, GRB afterglows, FRBs, and other
transient phenomena. The challenges outlined here are unique to DWF due to the fast cadence and the opportunity
for transient detection on minute time-scales. It is these challenges that motivate the work presented here.
In this paper we present an automated, customizable fast transient identification algorithm centered mainly on
DWF source light curve analysis. We summarize the DWF program in Section 2 and describe the DWF data sets
analyzed in this work. In Section 3 we motivate the need for a transient detection algorithm that is independent from
image subtraction, and present the elements of a novel fast transient detection algorithm. The results of running the
algorithm on both real-time DWF data and later-time further processed data sets is presented in Section 4. Finally
in Section 5, we describe how this algorithm will be deployed in future DWF runs.
2. DEEPER, WIDER, FASTER PROGRAM
The Deeper, Wider, Faster program (DWF, Andreoni & Cooke 2019), is peculiar among all the aforementioned
transient surveys. The primary goal of DWF is to identify transient phenomena on the shortest timescales; DWF
searches from milliseconds to hours in various wavelengths. The deep optical component of DWF is carried out by
the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) collecting 20s exposures in a 1 minute cadence, at g ∼ 23 magnitude limits, a
wide-field (∼ 3 deg2
) of view (a comparison of DWF with other surveys can be found in Table 1). In conjunction with
optical observations carried out with DECam on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile, wide-field ground- and space-based
observatories spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum are coordinated either to simultaneously collect data on
the same region of the sky, or coordinated to trigger rapid (or later-time) follow-up of transient sources. Data collected
by DECam for real-time analysis is highly compressed (Vohl et al. 2017), to minimize transfer speed, and sent directly
from the summit on Cerro Tololo, Chile to the OzSTAR supercomputer at Swinburne University of Technology in
Australia for processing and analysis. In addition, these data are also transferred using lossless compression and fully
processed by a modified version of the photpipe NOAO Community Pipeline (Rest et al. 2005; Swaters & Valdes 2007;
Valdes & Swaters 2007) at a later time.
The DWF program, like many other transient surveys (e.g., PTF and SN Legacy Survey, among others, Cao et al.
2016; Perrett et al. 2010), relies on an image subtraction pipeline (Mary pipeline, Andreoni et al. 2017) to detect
potential sources of interest in real time. A ranked list of candidates is presented to astronomers and volunteers for
further visual inspection of image cutouts (small fraction of the DECam FOV centered on a single detected source)
and light curves using the interactive tools described in Meade et al. (2017).
2.1. DWF Data Samples
Here, we describe the DWF data stream in more detail, the light curve creation process, and the final inputs
that will be fed into the transient identification algorithm. The data collected by DECam for the DWF program is
unique among transient surveys in its cadence, and therefore some of its discoveries are the first of their kind. For
DWF, the 4-meter Blanco telescope, on which DECam is mounted, collects continuous 20s exposures at ∼ 1 minute
cadence, when including readout time. In each 20s exposure, DECam reaches a depth of g ∼ 23 under normal DWF
observing conditions, ∼ 1.0 arcsecond seeing at ∼ 1.5 airmass. The slightly higher than ideal airmass is due to the
visibility requirements for simultaneous observations in the radio, conducted by telescopes in either Australia or South
Africa, and telescopes operating at other wavelengths in the Antarctic, North America, and other locations, including
space-based telescopes.
The g-band is selected as the main observing band for DWF as DECam sensitivity is ∼ 0.5 magnitudes deeper than
in redder filters, many fast bursts are hot and blue, and DWF target fields are typically at low Galactic extinction.

Note—DWF fields analyzed as a part of this study. Fields noted with a +
are those with real-time data. Fields noted with a † are those that have
been analyzed in Webb et al. (2020).
Most DWF target fields have template reference images taken prior to the run in multiple filters. In addition, and if
there are no reference images (i.e., for newly discovered FRB or short-GRB fields), the target fields are observed either
at the start or end of the night (or both) in other filters, typically r- and i-bands to determine source colors.
The DWF program collects data with DECam over a ∼ 3 deg2 field of view. This wide-field is covered by the 62
individual DECam CCDs. The data from each CCD is saved as an extension in a multi-extension fits file. These data
are processed and analyzed in two ways.
Firstly, for real-time, or fast analysis, the image files are ‘lossy’, compressed at the summit using the method described
in Vohl et al. (2017), and sent to OzSTAR supercomputer at Swinburne University of Technology for data analysis.
Data transfer from the Cerro Tololo summit in Chile to Australia is too slow to enable data processing, analysis,
and transient candidate identification within minutes, which is necessary for fast transients. The lossy compression is
tunable to the speed of the internet and can speed up transfer by compressing the data up to ∼20× and still enable
detection of ∼ 95% of the transients. Furthermore, to enable fast identification and rapid response follow-up triggers,
these data are ‘fast’ processed in parallel on the OzSTAR supercomputer. The fast processing sacrifices some aspects
of a full processing pipeline for speed. Both the lossy compression and the fast processing result in several artifacts in
the images that are not typically observed in conventional transient pipeline analyses.
The real-time data processing for the data collected on the dates used in this work includes using Swarp (Bertin et al.
2002) to align and stack images, SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to identify sources, and HOTPANTS (Becker
2015) to perform image subtractions. After performing image subtraction and source extraction on the differenced
images, the Mary pipeline (Andreoni et al. 2017) runs a machine learning algorithm on the potential candidates to
minimize CCD artifacts. The remaining candidates are then ranked based on their presence in The Second-Generation
Guide Star Catalog (GSC-II, Lasker et al. 2008) and in previous nights of the DWF run, with higher rankings given
to those sources that are present in neither GSC-II, nor previous DWF nights. Data analyzed in this manner will be
referred to as “real-time” data. We note that the real-time processing is different for later runs.
Secondly, the data are separately sent to the NOAO High-Performance Pipeline System (Swaters & Valdes 2007;
Valdes & Swaters 2007) to provide post-run, fully processed and well-calibrated data for later-time analyses. These
data are used for fast transient detection after burst, fast transient searches cross-matched with other wavelengths,
fast transients associated with slower-evolving events (e.g., supernova shock breakouts), slower-evolving events caught
early by DWF, and other applications. For the data used here, sources were identified using SExtractor and the images
are not stacked, nor image subtracted, however. Magnitudes from SExtractor identified sources are calibrated against
the SkyMapper Data Release 2 catalogue (Onken et al. 2019). Data analyzed in this manner will be referred to as
“post-run” data. For both data processing methods, the light curves are generated for sources that have one or more
detections at the same coordinates; DWF targets are named using these coordinates. For each DWF source, a data
point or upper limit is generated every ∼ 1 minute, unless the source location falls off the CCD, either in chip gaps or
off the edge of DECam field of view as a result of small offsets in guiding, tracking, and hexapod tip-tile corrections,
as a result of changing weather, moving to a new field, etc.
6 Strausbaugh et al.
There are a total of 5 DWF fields analyzed in this work, shown in Table 2. There are 2 “real-time” data sets covering
the CDFS Legacy and FRB171019 fields. There are 5 “post-run” data sets covering two epochs on the 4-hour and
Antlia fields and one epoch on the FRB010724 field. The two 4-hour and Antlia epochs analyzed here are from two
separate runs, spaced 11 months and 16 months apart, respectively; this second pointing can help establish if there is
any recurrence or periodicity to transient behavior observed.
The 4-hour field is one of the first fields observed by DWF. The first DWF run employed an observational routine
with dithering. Analyzing the first run on the 4-hour field can determine how robust the FTF algorithm is to dithered
data; subsequent DWF runs have moved away from the dithered approach due to confounding issues discussed in
Section 4.1. The Antlia field was chosen for analysis, in part because comparisons can be drawn between this work,
and work done in Webb et al. (2020). The FRB010724 data is from a dense field with 839,729 light curves generated
over 5 days. The two “real-time” fields were chosen out of necessity; older “real-time” data was not stored for later
analysis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has halted operations for many observing sites across the world, had
precluded the acquisition of “real-time” data sets from Cerro Tololo for several months. The results of running the
FTF algorithm on the 5 data sets in Table 2 are presented in Section 4. The naming convention for the light curves
presented in this paper are the survey name, DWF, followed by the right ascension (RA) and declination (DEC) in
sexagesimal coordinates as follows: DWFRADEC.
3. ALGORITHM FOR EARLY SOURCE DETECTION
Despite its ubiquity, the use of image subtraction techniques to identify transient sources is wrought with challenges.
The convolution of PSFs between images can be challenging, if not impossible between different instruments and
different seeing conditions; even when feasible, convolution can be computationally intensive. The very large number
of source detections in image subtracted frames and the inability to have humans analyze them all in a reasonable time
frame (especially for fast transients), or do so with any solid accuracy to trigger followup observations, necessitates the
use of machine learning frameworks to identify false-positives (Masci et al. 2017; Díaz et al. 2016; Duev et al. 2019),
further complicating the process and increasing computational demands. Source extraction codes (e.g., SExtractor)
can be fooled by sources that are not real, for example cosmic rays, cross-talk on images, or mis-aligned subtractions.
As surveys search for transients to fainter magnitudes, they begin to hit the noise/source threshold and many detections
are too ambiguous to accurately identify.
Furthermore, the machine-learning (ML) approach requires extensive training and large training set samples (typically in the hundreds of thousands of images), increasing the demands on human time and capital. The challenges
associated with image subtraction have led to attempts to identify transient sources through real-time direct image
comparisons (Wardęga et al. 2020), light curve analysis (Liu et al. 2020), or late-time light curve analysis (e.g., Webb
et al. 2020).
In addition, definitive source classification is hardly possible with image subtraction alone: transient characterization
is confirmed through follow-up observations, including spectroscopic data; however, telescope time using sensitive
spectroscopic instruments is very limited, and the time-window for observing fast-fading sources is narrower than the
cadence of conventional transient surveys. If enough data of the source is rapidly available for a light curve to be made
(e.g. within a few minutes of the first data acquisition), preliminary classification can be performed, using simple
metrics such as its rise and/or decay rate and peak brightness. This early classification using light curves can inform
astronomers about the resources they should allocate to these targets which are always limited; this kind of observation
strategy will be crucial for LSST, and is the service that brokers will be performing for the community (Förster et al.
2020; Narayan et al. 2018; Narayan et al. 2018; Smith 2019; Patterson et al. 2019; Möller et al. 2021). With better
sampling, including light curves spanning multiple wavelength bands, a more precise classification of sources can be
achieved (Bloom et al. 2012; Ball et al. 2006; Debosscher et al. 2007; Richards et al. 2011; Kim & Bailer-Jones 2016;
Jamal & Bloom 2020), but progress on this front is still minimal due to the complexity of the data and classification
algorithms.
3.1. Fast Transient Finding (FTF) Algorithm
Given the obstacles inherent in using image subtraction techniques, and the necessity of a light curve analysis to
classify peculiar transient events, we propose to identify these transient phenomena with a direct light curve analysis of
the DWF data stream. The algorithm we describe can be used as an independent verification for candidates detected
Fast Transient Finding Algorithm 7
via other methods (e.g. image subtraction, machine learning algorithms); a flow chart of the FTF algorithm is shown
in Figure 2.
Figure 2. For a given DWF field, a total number of N sources are detected. A light curve (LC) will be generated for each
source during post-run processing, or in real-time for those sources identified as potential transients from image subtraction (see
Section 2.1 for a thorough discussion of the different data types). Each LC is fed into the algorithm described in Section 3.1 in
a parallel-processed manner. The LCs are separated into n − (SW − 1) different sliding windows, where n is the number of data
points in the LC and SW is the size of the sliding window. Each of these sliding windows are processed in parallel, fit linearly,
and the sign of the slope is determined: positive, negative, or flat. The signs from the slopes of the individual sliding windows
is recombined and the number of inflection points (IPs) in the LC is counted. Those LCs with fewer than 5 IPs are saved as
potential transients.
For each unique source observed during the DWF run, we separate the light curve data using a sliding window (SW),
a technique common in financial time series analysis (Chou & Nguyen 2018; Chou & Truong 2019; Karathanasopoulos
et al. 2016) as well as machine learning applications across several disciplines (Dietterich 2002; Kaneda & Mineno
2016; Selvin et al. 2017; Helwan & Uzun Ozsahin 2017). The user can define the size of the sliding window parameter,
but is limited by the number of data points contained within an individual light curve file (light curves may have
missing points due to changing weather conditions, upper limits, or artifacts that prevent our photometric pipeline to
accurately estimate the magnitude of the source).
3.2. Statistical Selection of Algorithm Parameters
Based on the typical field cadence and the number of points per light curve we can assess the best SW size.
We emphasize here that, while we focus in this paper on finding known categories of fast evolving transients (e.g.,
GRB afterglows, kilonovae, etc.) the FTF algorithm can be easily customized for different or novel types of variable
phenomena by changing the sliding window size (Figure 3) and the slope threshold (Figure 4); searches for new types
of fast-evolving transients is an important focus of DWF and we will us the FTF to pursue these targets in the future.
In Figure 3, we present the histograms of the number of data points present in each light curve for all of the fields and
runs analyzed in this work, for both the “real-time” and “post-run” data. The red dashed line in Figure 3 represents
our choice of a SW=5; this avoids the predominance of noisy light curves (SW  5) and mitigates the risk of averaging
over rapidly rising and falling light curves or flares with larger windows (SW  5).
Over each sliding window, we compute a simple linear fit, g = αt + g0 (where g is the observed magnitude, t is the
time in minutes from the first observation, α is the temporal decay index, and g0 is the intercept), and return the
slope and its uncertainty.
A histogram of the slopes of each window from real-time and post-processed fields is plotted in the two graphs in
Figure 4. We find that the distributions of slopes is well-modeled with a Laplace Distribution, represented by the

analyzed in this work in both the real-time data (left) and post-run processed data (right) sets. The red dashed line is plotted
at 5, the chosen sliding window size in the FTF algorithm explored in this paper; the sliding window parameter can be changed
to search for transients evolving on different time scales.
Figure 4. Histograms of the slope of each separate sliding window for the real-time data (left) and the post-run processed
data (right). We fit the histogram with a Laplacian Distribution, as defined in Equation 1 and plot the b term, with a red
dashed line; the slopes within the red dashed lines are considered “flat” in the FTF algorithm explored in this paper; this slope
threshold can be tuned to search for transients with different intensities, as shown by the blue dashed line in Figure 5.

where µ is the mean (which, in the case of this function is equal to the median as well as the mode), the variance is

, and the average absolute deviation is b. From the linear fits, we obtain the sign of each window slope as positive,
negative, or flat; we consider a flat (non-changing) slope if α = 0 ± b, as shown by the red dashed lines in Figure 4.
The algorithm keeps track of the sign of the slope over each sliding window and notes a change in the sign of the
slope as an inflection point (IP). Scanning over each sliding window, the algorithm tallies and records the number of
IPs. For example, a typical fast previously unknown transient may have a number of IPs between 0 (straight rising or
decay behavior) and 3 (e.g. a flare with one IP rising, one IP fading, and one IP flat).
The aforementioned process is time consuming and CPU-intensive. Since our ultimate goal is to provide real-time
identification of fast transients from the DWF data stream we implement a full parallelization of our python-based
algorithm; each target can be run independently and in parallel during the DWF run. This parallelization enables the
code to run over each DWF source in . 1 minute, on par with the cadence of incoming data points. The efficiency
Fast Transient Finding Algorithm 9
of the code is important for real-time identification of transients, especially deployed on multi-core CPUs, like the
supercomputer at Swinburne University, where the optical data from DWF runs is analyzed.
3.3. Phenomenological Selection of Number of Inflection Points
For each light curve we calculate the number of IPs and then we group all objects and light curves with the same
number of IPs. For this work, we focus on light curves that have four or fewer IPs within the typical DWF light curve
(∼1 hour).
• Light curves with zero IPs, but that are monotonically increasing or decreasing could be longer evolving transients:
Cepheids, RR Lyrae, or SNe, for example.
• Light curves with one IP might be catching the start of the rise or fall of a transient evolving on minutes to days
time scales.
• Light curves with two or three IPs may contain peaks or dips spanning the entire DWF time on the field (typically
1-4 hours).
• Four IP light curves could point towards more complex behavior that goes through several phases over the course
of the DWF observation.
It is important to note that transient phenomena may be occurring before the DWF run began, or continue after
data acquisition has stopped. Therefore, a burst like event might only have two or three IPs, as its light curve might
be shifted towards the beginning or end of a run in such a way that some parts of the curve are not sampled.
Using this algorithm, the first potential transients can be reported just after the first five minutes of observation
by DWF; thereafter the number of IPs associated with each light curve will be updated every minute, as the sliding
window shifts over by one data point. A noted inflection change with a corresponding positive detection in the image
subtraction pipeline provides good evidence to trigger imaging and spectroscopic follow-up.
3.4. FTF Algorithm Demonstration
In Figure 5 we show how the FTF algorithm works on a sample light curve, using a flaring star first detected in
Webb et al. (2020) as an example. The light curve for this flaring source, DWF102955.559-360035.170, is plotted in
the left panel of Figure 5. The right panel in Figure 5 shows the slope derived from each sliding window as function
of time. We can clearly see that the flare in the light curve and the relative inflection points enable the identification
of a change in brightness beyond the typical brightness. While this information may be used to trigger follow up
observations, the subsequent data demonstrate that there are more inflection points and therefore the source is not a
fast transient as classified in Section 3.3. The dashed red lines in the figure represent the same thresholds identified in
the histograms presented in Figure 4; users can set a different threshold to identify different transients of interest, as
shown by the blue dashed lines.
4. RESULTS
In this section we present the outcome of our FTF algorithm and the implication on 1) detectability of fast transients
of different natures and the rate of detection of these objects compared to other surveys and 2) the required effort for
spectroscopic follow-up for secure classification. In summary:
• On a single night of observation on a single field we obtained on average ∼ 50, 000 real-time light curves, and
∼ 340, 000 post-processed light curves.
• Feeding these 50, 000 real-time and 340, 000 post-processed light curves into the FTF algorithm, we detect, on
average 150 (∼ 3%) and 3, 000 (. 1%) potential fast transients respectively.
• Checking the science frames of the potential fast transients for artifacts and other non-astronomical sources, we
obtained on average, 1 statistically significant fast transient per field in the real-time data, and 13 statistically
significant fast transients per field in the post-processed data.
• Based on light curve fits 69 sources can be classified as fast transients under our definition in Section 3.1 from
the fields described in Table 2.

1 and plotted in Figure 4. The blue dashed line represents a more restrictive parameter that can be tuned in the algorithm if
for example, astronomers are looking specifically for flare stars.
• In the event of a fast transient identification, FTF would allow a latency time of just 5-15 minutes for multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up observations.
A detailed break-down of the results over each field can be found in Table 3.
4.1. Results on Real-Time and Post-Run Data
Once a list of candidates is generated using the FTF algorithm (within the first 5-10 minutes of the run, and then
every minute thereafter), as shown in Section 3.4, light curves are vetted by our team; for those light curves that
passed human inspection, image cutouts for the source’s location on the sky were visually inspected to exclude the
presence of artifacts that survived our processing pipeline (e.g., cosmic rays, bad pixels, bad rows/columns, etc.).
For the purposes of this paper, a positive detection is defined as one where the source is either a known variable, a
DWF variable detected by other methods (see for example, Webb et al. 2020), or a newly discovered candidate that
passes a visual inspection of the images associated with the light curves. To confirm known variables, we checked the
coordinates of our candidates against known variable source catalogs such as the General Catalog of Variable Stars
(Samus’ et al. 2017) and the International Variable Star Index (Watson et al. 2017).
It is important to note that the real-time light curves will only exist for those sources that were candidates identified
via image subtraction as a part of the Mary pipeline analysis; in contrast, the light curves from the post-run processing
with the NOAO pipeline encompasses all sources that were detected during the run. The linear fits plotted in the
subsequent figures (Figures 6-10) are meant to give an idea of the general trends in the lights curves, and are not the
slopes associated with the sliding windows, as shown in Section 3.4, nor are they necessarily the best fit for the data.
The light curve of DWF011805.113-751125.458, plotted in the left panel of Figure 6 is a known RR Lyrae source,
called BG Tuc (Hoffmeister 1963; Geßner 1981). The light curves of DWF011805.113-751125.458 for each night of the
DWF observing run are plotted in the right panel of Figure 6; this figure shows the variability of the object over long
time scales.
The behavior of DWF102920.187-355700.211 on both the night of 180607, plotted in the upper left and panel of
Figure 7, and 1800608, plotted in the upper right panel of Figure 7, were identified by the FTF algorithm as potential
transient phenomena. The first night of data shows a source decreasing from g ∼ 17.6 to g ∼ 18.4 in 30 minutes of
observation. The data from the second night shows a source with a baseline magnitude of g ∼ 20 that dips dramatically,
twice: once by 2 magnitudes and a second time by 1.5 magnitudes, each occurring in the space of a few minutes. Visual
inspection of the first night of data revealed no signs of contamination by non-astrophysical sources. The analysis of
the data from the second night, shown in the bottom panel of Figure 7, reveals that DWF102920.187-355700.211 and
the dimmer stars in the vicinity all become very faint; clouds passing over this region of the sky would account for the
apparent dimming of the source during the second night. We believe that DWF102920.187-355700.211 was displaying

some genuine transient phenomena on the first night of observation before reaching a quiescent phase in the second
and third nights.
In Figure 8, we present two light curves that showcase when the FTF can identify a fast evolving transient in the
DWF “real-time” data stream, and how quickly astronomers can trigger other resources. The left panel shows the
source DWF040623.456-550041.171 around g ∼ 17 before dropping by 0.7 magnitudes over a 10 minute period. For
a source like this, the FTF algorithm would alert astronomers within the first few data points (within 10 minutes
in the case) after the light curve deviates from a flat position. The right panel of Figure 8 shows the light curve of
DWF102613.233-350150.332 rising by about 0.8 magnitudes in 40 minutes, before undergoing a seemingly exponential
decay over the remainder of the observations. This source would be identified as a potential transient after the first 5
data points, due to the steep nature of its increasing brightness. Furthermore, the FTF algorithm would identify an

be contamination from non-astrophysical effects in the image cutouts from this night of data, so we identify this source as real.

inflection point within 10 minutes of the object’s drop in brightness, notifying astronomers of a change in the behavior
of this object.
4.2. Transient Misidentification
In this section we present a sample of light curves that were identified as possible transients by the FTF algorithm,
but after further analysis, were determined to be bogus. The most common type of light curve that confounded the
FTF algorithm were those involving an astronomical source interacting with the edge of one of the 62 science CCDs
that make up the DECam detector (Honscheid & DePoy 2008), pictured in Figure 1 under the label DES (Dark Energy
Survey); the number of CCDs increases the chance for edge interactions. As the source moves onto or off of a CCD
the light curve can show a peak or a dip not unlike that mimicking a fast rising or fading transient. This effect was
exacerbated by early DWF observational strategies employing dithering routine (e.g., the first run on the 4-hour field
analyzed in this paper); dithering patterns are no longer favored by DWF, in part for this reason. This issue can be
remedied by ignoring data collected near the edge of a detector. This information is not always available in cataloged
data sets, but can be easily identified using software analyzing the dimensions of the science image (i.e. is it square?)
and by machine learning algorithms.
Fast Transient Finding Algorithm 13
Figure 8. Left: The light curve of DWF040623.456-550041.171 is presented. The first 10 data points in the light curve are
consistent with the flat slope defined in Section 3.1. The source then dims by 0.8 mangitudes in about 10 minutes. After the
first data point in this decay, the FTF algorithm will note this object as a potential fast transient. Right: The light curve of
DWF102613.233-350150.332 is presented. The first 5 data points in this light curve would indicate this object as a potential
fast transient. The light curve then enters into a period of seemingly exponential decay for the remainder of observation. The
algorithm would detect this inflection change, again alerting astronomers about the potential transient nature of this source. In
both cases present in this figure, the FTF algorithm can alert astronomers within 5-10 minutes of the transient behavior.
Figure 9. Left: Light curve of DWF040903.800-554603.567 that was flagged by the FTF algorithm as a potential transient,
due to the fast 0.1 magnitude drop, and the slower, further 0.1 magnitude decay. Right: Image cutouts centered on the position
of DWF040903.800-554603.567 on the sky. These image cutouts show the source moving off the edge of the CCD, causing the
decreasing light curve.
In Figure 9, we present an example of an astronomical source DWF040903.800-554603.567 appearing to exhibit
transient behavior. In the left panel of Figure 9, the light curve dims by > 0.1 magnitude in one minute before
continuing to decay over the next five minutes. Upon visual inspection of the fits images (in the right panel of Figure
9, it is clear that the telescope shifted slightly, placing the source on the edge of the detector, and afterwards, the
sources is slowly moving out of frame.
In Figure 10, we present a light curve that was misidentified as a transient due to edge effects, but for a slightly different reason than that shown in Figure 9. In the left panel of Figure 10, we present the light curve of DWF040748.870-
541956.717 that appears at a magnitude of g ≈ 19.7 out of a 5σ background upper limit of g < 22.5. The source then
proceeds to decay by 0.6 magnitudes over the course of about 7 minutes. Upon inspection of the images, shown in the
right panel of Figure 10, a bright source is shown moving out of frame. We suspect that the cause of the appearance of
the source at g ≈ 19.7 more than 50 minutes after the observation of the field began is the following: 1) a bright star
was present in the field at coordinates slightly offset from those of DWF040748.870-541956.717, 2) this bright source
began to move out of frame, 3) eventually the centroid of the star is out of frame, but light from the star is still being

This source seems to appear at g ∼ 19.7 before rapidly fading by ∼0.6 magnitudes in 7 minutes. Right: Image cutouts centered
on the position of DWF040748.870-541956.717 on the sky. Upon further inspection, it appears that a bright source is on the
edge of the CCD; as it moves further off the edge, a small section of the star is still visible. This small bit of flux is assigned to
coordinates still in the field of view of this CCD, and a new source is generated in the catalog. As the source continues to move
off the CCD, the measured flux decreases.
detected; the NOAO pipeline then identifies a new source using coordinates in frame 4) as the source continues to
move out of frame, the brightness of the object continues to decrease.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The Deeper, Wider, Faster program is unique in terms of its depth (g ∼ 23 per image) and its short cadence (∼
1 minute) when compared to other transient surveys, occupying a parameter space with a distinct lack of coverage
(e.g., Andreoni et al. 2020b, Figure 6). In addition to its depth and cadence, DWF offers a new way to explore
transient phenomena due to the simultaneous wide-field multi-wavelength observations performed across the entire
electromagnetic spectrum. Identification of transient phenomena in transient surveys has so far relied on the imperfect
science of image subtraction. The rudimentary classification of transient phenomena requires analysis of the light
curves of these objects, with more refined classifications relying heavily on a spectral analysis of the object.
In this work, we present the Fast Transient Finding algorithm, capable of identifying transient phenomena both
independently of image subtraction, and in tandem with an image subtraction algorithm, on the DWF data stream
light curves. We focused on identifying fast transients (e.g., explosive phenomena) in this paper, but also demonstrate
how the FTF algorithm can be customized to find other kinds transients and variables.
This type of algorithm occupies a unique space within the transient detection landscape. Most currently operating optical surveys (e.g., ZTF) do not detect intra-night variability, and as such, miss the opportunity to alert the
community for possible follow-up on fast evolving transients such as GRB and FRB counterparts.
We see the work in this paper as the first step towards implementation of real time transient classification. We
will first identify potential transients using the FTF algorithm. Next we will combine the multi-wavelength data sets
obtained by the DWF for sources of interest. We will either extract features from this combined multi-frequency data
set or run a deep learning classification algorithm in real-time (Cucchiara et al. in preparation).
The FTF algorithm will be incorporated into the DWF pipeline and deployed on the next DWF run, as shown
in Figure 11. In its first iterations the algorithm will be working off of the light curves generated by the image
subtractions performed by the Mary pipeline (Andreoni et al. 2017). When a source is first identified as a candidate
by image subtraction, a light curve will begin to be populated for that source. If the slope of the light curve of that
source is above some threshold, which we can select manually for specific sources (very high for flare stars or slightly
lower for slower evolving transients) or automatically using a statistical measure (e.g. Figure 4), then that source will
be identified as a potential fast transient candidate. Candidates from the image subtraction are provided to human
observers using interactive visualization tools. We will give priority to sources that are flagged as potential transients
by the FTF algorithm, as these sources are both image-subtracted candidates and FTF candidates. As more data is

new data flows described in this paper. Data from DECam are compressed (Vohl et al. 2017) and sent to Australia for analysis.
The images are processed by the Mary Pipeline (Andreoni et al. 2017) and image subtractions are performed. Light curves of
sources flagged through image subtraction are fed to the FTF algorithm. The light curves are analyzed and the results are fed
to the Data Visualization (e.g., Meade et al. 2017), or used directly to trigger follow-up observations.

image subtracted and FTF candidates to classify these sources in real-time (e.g. with detailed spectra).
