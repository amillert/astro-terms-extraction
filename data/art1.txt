Imprints of decaying dark matter on cosmic voids
The Standard Cosmological Model assumes that more than 85% of matter is in the form of
collisionless and pressureless dark matter. Unstable decaying dark matter has been proposed in the
literature as an extension to the standard cold dark matter model. In this paper we investigate a
scenario when dark matter decays and the resultant particle moves with respect to the dark matter.
A covariant hydrodynamical model is developed in which the decay is modeled by the transfer of
energy-momentum between two dark dust fluid components. We parameterise the model in terms
of the decay rate Γ and injection velocity vi of the resultant dark matter particles. We apply
the framework to study the evolution of cosmic voids which are environments with low content of
baryonic matter. Thus, unlike baryon-rich environments, voids provide an opportunity to measure
dark matter signals that are less contaminated by complex baryonic processes. We find that the
growth of S-type voids is modified by the dark matter decay, leading to imprints at the present day.
This paper serves as a proof-of-concept that cosmic voids can be used to study dark mater physics.
We argue that future cosmological observations of voids should focus on signs of reported features to
either confirm or rule out the decaying dark matter scenario. Lack of presence of reported features
could put constraints of the decay of dark matter in terms of Γ > H−1
0 and vi < 10 km/s.
I. INTRODUCTION
The status of Dark Matter (DM) is as an open problem
in modern physics. As DM is known to form the majority of the universal matter content, its presence plays a
important part in cosmological modelling and observations. Yet, constraints on the possible particle properties
of DM via direct or indirect detection experiments have
been inconclusive [1], and DM particles have never been
directly detected in an experiment on Earth [2, 3]. Cosmology and astrophysics offer a laboratory of sorts to
explore the effects of particle physics, [4].
In the standard cosmological model the source of the
gravitational field is a perfect fluid and dark matter is
often modelled as a pressureless and collisionless weakly
interacting massive particle (WIMP) which in the light
of experimental data (or rather lack of thereof) will need
to be replaced with some other candidate [5]. However,
it is well known that the standard Cold Dark Matter
(CDM) model seems to be inadequate on sub-galactic
scales (< 1 Mpc) [6]. This has motivated investigations
into modifications to the standard model such as Warm
Dark Matter (WDM) which damps the production of lowmass objects, [7]. Alternatively, interactions in the dark
sector have been investigated in recent years. Models of
DM interactions include annihilation, scattering or decay (DDM) and offer simple extensions of the standard
WIMP models which retain the desirable properties of
CDM while offering possible resolutions to known tensions and discrepancies between theory and observation,
[1, 6, 8]. Strongly self-interacting modifications to CDM
include collisional DM suggested by [9] to account for flat

density profiles of galaxy cores but ruled out by [10, 11];
and self-annihilation with a quadratic dependence on
density is prevalent in galaxy cores, [1], but must be carefully contrived to avoid complete self-annihilation in the
early universe, [12]. Scattering processes such as DMphoton or DM-neutrino interactions have been shown to
have similar effects to warm DM models [6] while also
producing horizon-scale weak damping effects.
The effect of DM physics on cosmological structures
offers a way of using cosmological observations to gain
insight into possible interactions in the dark sector. Such
observables include high redshift data such as cosmic
dark ages and cosmic microwave background (CMB),
[13], or low-redshift data such as the effects of dark matter on galactic halos [1]. However astrophysical signals
such as, for example, DM annihilation [14, 15] have been
shown to be difficult to distinguish from signals produced
by baryonic processes [16, 17] making direct detection of
the products of annihilation at best inconclusive. Interactions could introduce additional effects that might
influence the overall evolution of the universe. These effects, such as decay and scattering, could lead to energy
or momentum flux, or viscosity making the fluid description of dark matter imperfect [18–20].
The focus of the present paper is decaying dark matter
(DDM) which has a linear density dependence and may
decay into two- or many- bodies with massless decay byproducts, and may feature kick or injection velocities of
relativistic order, [21]. Hence DDM may produce standard model particles, photons or exotic smaller mass dark
particles or dark radiation, [22, 23], and energy-injection
by cascade effects, [13], offering possible means of indirect detection. Unstable DDM is a natural development
beyond the canonical stable WIMP model.
One of the primary benefits of DDM is the early-time
correspondence of the model to CDM and consistency
with the CMB anisotropy spectrum while late-time ten-
2
sions within the CDM framework such as the missing
satellite problem are offered potential resolutions by the
long life-time instability of the DM particle, [8], – assuming a particle lifetime of order the current age of
the universe or longer. In this scenario, the observed
DM subhaloe underabundancy may be remedied by both
decay into relativistic, [24], or non-relativistic daughter
particles, [8]. Similarly, the correspondence of DDM with
CDM at high-redshift offers possible alleviation to, if not
resolution of, the observed tensions in H0 as inferred from
CMB and Type-1 Supernovae data, [25], as well as the σ8
matter fluctuations, [22]. However, recent work on relativistic single-species decay products have investigated
the similarity of the induced bulk viscosity and modified
cosmic acceleration with the negative pressure required
of dark energy, [26], and the signals constraining DDM
physics may be degenerate to other model modifications
such a modified Newtonian dynamics, [27].
The present work proposes to investigate the possible decay of DM into other dark particles via the effect
this may have upon the growth of large-scale structure,
specifically cosmological voids. Voids are chosen as these
offer an unique environment with several efficacious features. The under-abundance of galaxies in these avoided
regions suggests an inhomogeneous DM under-density,
[28], assuming a strong Light-to-Mass ratio, and therefore cosmic voids will have less significant annihilation or
self-interaction effects due to the quadratic mass dependency of these. Furthermore, these regions have minimal
baryonic contamination so that scattering and baryonic
feedback processes may be negligible. Thus, in cosmic
void regions the only remaining particle interaction which
may be introduced to modify DM and produce significant
signals, is decay.
As voids are the complementary structure of the filaments and sheets of the cosmic web, realistic analysis
cannot consider voids as isolated objects, [29]. The environmental dependence and hierarchical structure formation of voids creates a complex morphology which may
conveniently be classified by the dominant evolutionary
process determined by the surrounds: either expansion or
collapse, [30]. Larger voids are observed to generally fit
the former scenario corresponding to a void-in-void environmental configuration. The density profile of these
voids rises smoothly towards the mean background density and are classified as R-type in recent literature. Alternatively, the density profiles of smaller, S-type voids
exhibit a compensating shell suggesting a void-in-cloud
type configuration, [31]. In both the uncompensated and
compensated cases, there is a general trend of spherical voids evolving towards a bucket-shape density profile, [29]. Furthermore, the smoothing of asphericities as
under-densities grow, [32], validates the approximation of
spherically symmetric voids. Though not explored here,
the ellipticity of voids is an important measure of tidal
effects induced by the surrounding environment and offers an significant probe into cosmology and dark sector
physics, [33, 34]. Despite the intimate coupling of voids
with one another and the overall environment, the standard first-approximation of an isolated, spherically symmetric under-density is often adopted; we also do this
here since it offers an immediate quantitative and qualitative appreciation of the effect of proposed dark matter
decay upon void evolution.
As these cosmological voids are inhomogeneous and
evolve non-linearly, [35], the cosmology must move beyond the standard spatially homogeneous and isotropic
Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model.
Perturbative approaches may be employed but require
a stable background so cosmological back-reaction may
affect the accuracy of these models, and furthermore,
gauge issues may arise [36]. The Lemaˆıtre-Tolman-Bondi
(LTB) class of exact spherically symmetric dust solutions to the Einstein equations are inhomogeneous but
isotropic and are appropriate for simplified void models as pressure is generally negligible until shell-crossing
occurs, [37–41]. The Szekeres models are both inhomogeneous and anisotropic, [42] and have been employed in
the modelling of cosmological voids. These methods are
however constrained by the requirement of being metric
based. Recently, tetra-based methods have been developed as an alternative to LTB models, [43]. The wellestablished semi-tetrad approach of the hydrodynamical
1 + 3 covariant methodology has an intuitive fluid flow
interpretation, [18], and when taken to have local rotational symmetry (LRS) or silence (vanishing magnetic
Weyl and pressure gradients) offers a generalisation to
th LTB models in certain limits [44, 45]. In this paper
we adopt a fully general relativistic hydrodynamical 1 +
3 formulation with LRS, to which further simplifications
are imposed, see Section II.
The decay effect is proposed to be modeled by the oneway transfer of energy-density via long-lifetime nuclearlike decay from a dust fluid comoving with the fundamental observer (representative of the CDM, with baryonic
matter deemed insignificant and disregarded for the purposes of this model) into a secondary non-comoving fluid.
This is intended to represent a simple exponential decay
of the massive parent particle into a massive daughter
particle.
The average relative spatial velocity of the second noncomoving dust generated by the decay induces an effective imperfect fluid EM tensor in the frame of the
fundamental observer. Tilted models wherein imperfect
fluid effects arise have been studied in the literature, see
e.g. [46]. The presence of these imperfect terms corresponding to heat flux, pressure and viscosity induces nonFLRW effects such as shear or Weyl curvature (which
are identically zero for the FLRW models), which in turn
modifies the overall evolution of the cosmology and structure therein. However, for small peculiar velocities the
EM tensor approaches that of a dust with heat conduction, investigated earlier in [47] where an explicit form for
the space-time metric was determined, and more recently
in [48], wherein the momentum-transfer was interpreted
as the effect of a non-comoving fluid with non-relativistic
3
peculiar velocity, in accordance with the present work.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section II,
the tilted two-fluid, 1 + 3 covariant model is developed
which leads to a governing system of PDEs for a set of
scalars once LRS is imposed. This system of equations is
then employed in Section III to model spherically symmetric, isolated voids of the two types discussed above.
The results of numerical analysis of this system are presented and discussed, with an emphasis on the possibility
of using these results as an indirect means of constraining
DDM. Limitations of our model are also discussed, and
the article then concludes in Section IV.
II. METHODS
A. The 1+3 covariant framework
The tilted 1 + 3 covariant Lagrangian formalism is
employed. The model is chosen primarily owing to its
direct physical interpretation of the kinematic variables
adopted, and, secondly, for its proven capability of addressing non-linear evolution of which voids are a weak
example, [49]. We also remark on its prevalence in the
literature of relativistic cosmology.
Following e.g. [18, 50, 51], flow-orthogonal projections
are made to the spacetime by projection into the instantaneous rest space of an observer using
h
ab = g
ab + u
au
b
where g
ab is the metric tensor and u
a
the comoving 4-
velocity. The gradient of the 4-velocity field of the comoving observer is decomposed into vorticity, ωab, shear
σab, expansion Θ and acceleration Aa such that
ua;b = ωab + σab +
1

Θhab − Aanb . (1)
As mentioned in the introduction, some DDM models postulate the production of standard matter particles
which may be directly detected. However, in the present
investigation, we wish to determine possible means of indirect detection of DDM via the imprint on cosmological
voids, if any. Thus, for the purposes of this preliminary
work, it is sufficient to assume that the secondary fluid
produced via the decay is another dark fluid.
This work proposes a model involving two dust components: the first is comoving with the fundamental
observer, has density ρ and a normalised comoving 4-
velocity field u
a = δ
a
t
, and decays with a long-life time
into the second non-comoving resultant fluid with density ǫ and 4-velocity v
a
. The energy-momentum tensor
for the total fluid is taken to be the sum of these dust
components such that T
ab = Σ(i)T
ab
(i)
and hence,
T
ab = ρuau
b + ǫva
v
b
. (2)
The non-comoving velocity is tilted with respect to the
first by the Boost
v
a = γ(u
a + V
a
) (3)
with Lorentz factor γ = (1 − VaV
a
)
−1/2 and spacelike
peculiar velocity V
a
, [52].
Hence, an observer moving with u
a
, i.e. comoving with
the first fluid with density ρ, measures the total density
to be
µ = T
abuaub = ρ + η,
where η = γ

ǫ, the total pressure to be
p =

ab =

the heat flux to be
q
a = −(µua + uaT
ab) = ηV a
,
and the anisotropic stress as
πab = Tcdh

.
Thus, a comoving observer does not discern two dust
components, but rather the source of the gravitational
field is apparently a single imperfect fluid, which may be
described by
T
ab = µuau
b + phab + 2q
(au

. (4)
The assumption of LRS takes there to exist locally an
axis of symmetry or preferred spatial direction induced
by some properties of the flow (e.g. shear or vorticity),
such that at each event the spacetime exhibits partial
isotropy, [53]. Observations become independent of spatial dimensions orthogonal to the preferred spatial direction, [54, 55]. Hence, all spacelike covariant vector fields
in the LRS spacetime are proportional to the preferred
spacelike unit direction vector. Let this preferred spacelike unit vector be denoted by z
a and note that
z
a
za = 1, ua
za = 0.
Two new variables may be introduced to describe the
evolution of z
a
. The magnitude of the divergence α is
taken to be
α = Daz
a
,
where DaX = h
abX;b is the projected covariant derivative. The magnitude of the spatial rotation, or twist, τ,
is determined by
τ = −zaǫ
abcdudzc;b,
where ǫ
abcd is the Levi-Cita symbol. Note that it follows
that, [44],
z˙
a = 0, za
;a = α + A
a
za,
where X˙ = u
aX;a.
From the preferred spacelike unit vector z
a
is defined
the symmetric tensor
eab =
1
2
(3zazb − hab),
4
which has the properties, [44], that
e˙ab = 0, Dbe
ab =
3
2
αza
, ea
b
e
b
a =

2
.
By LRS, in order to reduce the above equations to a
scalar system, following [44] and [56], all spacelike covariant vector fields may be represented as
A
a = Aza
, V a = V za
, ωa = ωza
from which it follows that
q
a = Qza
, πab = Πe
ab
and
p =
1
3
ηV 2
, Q = ηV, Π = 2
3
ηV 2
.
In a similar fashion as above, LRS allows all the irreducible kinematic components of the shear and Electric
and Magnetic parts of the Weyl tensors to be written in
terms of scalars such as
σ
ab = Σe
ab, Eab = W eab, Hab = Beab
.
The substitution of the above into the 1 + 3 covariant
governing equations (see e.g. [51], and, adopting, for this
section, units such that c = 8πG), produces the following

B. Pressureless, irrotational and dissipative fluids
In order to further simplify the system the stringent
conditions of irrotationality i.e. vanishing vorticity, ω =
0, and twist, τ = 0, are assumed. The former ensures the
existence of a well-defined cosmological time. It follows
via the constraint equation (13) that a twist-free, irrotational flow is necessarily purely gravito-electric such that
B = 0.
The vanishing of the effective pressure scalars p and
Π and heat scalar Q immediately follows in the limit of
V → 0. In this situation, the model reduces to the wellknow spherically symmetric LTB cosmology. As mentioned in the introduction, exact homogeneous solutions
featuring dissipative dust were found and analysed in
[47]. Early research explored inhomogeneous dust models
with heat flow, generalising the subclasses of inhomogeneous and anisotropic Szekeres solutions [57]. However,
as recently pointed out by [58], the heat flow of dissipative
dust models is inappropriate for standard CDM and latetime universe models, and is analogous to the energy flux
induced in the observer frame by a non-comoving, nonrelativistic peculiar velocity. The two-fluid tilted model
developed here has produced an effectively imperfect total EM tensor.
Observational analyses of large-scale peculiar velocities
suggest non-relativistic orders. It therefore seems valid
to assume a non-relativistic, non-comoving peculiar velocity of the second fluid such that γ ≈ 1, and the effective pressure scalars p and Π become second-order and
negligible. The effective heat scalar Q, however, is not.
The tractability of the mathematical model is further increased by assuming that the covariantly projected dot
and prime derivatives of the effective pressures are also
first order and negligible. This is justified as the initial
velocity distribution is taken to be homogeneous, and
hence, all terms featuring p or Π vanish.
The above assumptions lead to the set of propagation

Therefore, to close this system an evolution equation
for the unknown spatial divergence α is required. This
is determined by application of the Voss-Weyl divergence
formula to the comoving 4-velocity u
a
, and to the preferred spatial direction z
a
, giving, respectively
Θ = ν˙
ν
and α =
ν
′
ν
, (24)
where ν =
√
−g, with g representing the metric determinant.
Hence, the system formed by Equations (17) - (24),
serves as a closed set of evolution equations which,
given appropriate initial conditions, may be numerically
marched forward in time. The constraints may be helpful
as an alternate substantiation of the results of evolving
the system.
In addition, one can define the scale factor a
a =

ν
νi
1/3
. (25)
In general the scale factor defined in this way is a function
of both time and position but in the FLRW limit the scale
factor becomes a function of time only, i.e. a = a(t) and
a
′ = 0.
C. FLRW limit
In order to facilitate a comparison with the standard
model and a discussion of the modifications introduced,
briefly consider necessary and sufficient conditions for a
spacetime to be FLRW [42]:
1. the metric obeys the Einstein equations with a perfect fluid source; and
2. the velocity field of the perfect fluid source has zero
rotation, shear and acceleration.
The first condition requires
Q = 0,
while the second condition gives
Σ = 0, and A = 0.
Since these requirements must be fulfilled at all times,
it follows from (18) that
W = 0.
This is expected as the FLRW models are conformally
flat (i.e. the Weyl curvature vanishes). These conditions,
together with (14) require that µ
′ = 0, which in turn via
(20) implies that Θ′ = 0, meaning all gradients vanish,
including a
′ = 0.
Using (24) and (25) it follows that the Hubble parameter
a˙
a
≡ H = 3Θ. (26)
This implies that the Raychaudhuri equation (17) reduces to the 2nd Friedmann equation, which together
with the continuity equation (20) yields the 1st Friedmann equation

observations are adopted so that ΩK = 0, ΩM = 0.308,
ΩΛ = 0.692 and H0 = 67.81 km s−1 Mpc−1
, [59].
D. Initial conditions
The model begins from the last scattering instant
(CMB), the redshift of which is taken to be zCMB =
1090. At the initial instant, it is assumed there exists
only a single, comoving dust fluid. Then V = 0 and the
system is approximated by an exact spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein equations for the gravitational
6
field sourced by dust only, i.e. the LTB model. In this,
the fluid quantities are

. (37)
Thus, to specify the LTB model, and in our case the
initial condition, one is required to provide the two functions: M(R) and R˙(R).
The two void configurations discussed in the introduction will be explored in this work by specifying initial
conditions for these types separately. In both cases it
is assumed that the radial coordinate coincides initially
with the function R, i.e.
r = R|
ti ⇒ R
′
|
ti
= 1 (38)
ti = tCMB. (39)
The above is equivalent to defining the scale factor to
be ai = 1 when t = ti
. The standard convention is to
set the scale factor at present to unity and put a(z) =
1/(1 + zCMB). However, this scaling does not have any
physical meaning, so does not influence the evolution of
the system, and it is more convenient to set the scale
factor to unity at the CMB (when the model is almost
homogeneous) than at the present time (when the system
is far from FLRW).
Due to the system being not FLRW the evolution of
the radius R does not follow a simple FLRW scaling so
that R 6= ar = r(1 + z)/(1 + zCMB). However, for the
structures considered here (cosmic voids and present-day
scales of Mpc), when calculating the physical distance
from the origin to a considered point, this is approximated by
R(r, t) ≈
Zr
0
dr a(t, r), (40)
where the value of the scale factor a(t, r) follows from
(25). The above approximation neglects the contribution
from the spatial curvature K. While the function K is
known at the initial instant, dissipate processes mean
that it is not a function of r (as in LTB models) but
evolves in time [61].
It is important to emphasise that the value of R does
not affect the evolution of the system governed by (17)
– (21). Rather, it is only used for plotting purposes to
represent graphically the physical quantities, i.e. rather
than plotting fluid variable (i.e. µ, Θ, Σ, W, or Q) as a
function of r (in Kpc), in Sec. III these quantities are
plotted in terms of R, as given by (40).
1. S-type voids
The S-type voids are surrounded by a compensating
shell, i.e. the mass of the system outside the void is approximately the same as the mass of a region of a similar
size but otherwise homogeneous. For the S-type voids,
the initial profile for the function M is taken to be

to existence of pure growing modes [60, 62]. This set of
parameters leads to a void that at its central part has a
density contrast of δ0 = −0.9 (cf. Fig. 1).
2. R-type
A void of R-type has a continuously rising density profile, without a compensating shell. Such a shape may be
modelled with a pure Gaussian density fluctuation, and
then it follows from (35), that the function M(r) when
t = ti

E. Dark Matter physics
The gravitational field in the present model is sourced
by DM only which is assumed to consist of two fluids: the
original comoving dark dust fluid that decays into a secondary dark dust fluid which is non-comoving. In order
to account for the interaction, the conservation equations
for each fluid must be satisfied in the form

is a vector that describes initial velocity

The temporal component of (43) is a typical decay law.
Indeed, using ρ = N/V and V /V ˙ = Θ, this equation can
be re-written as
N˙ = −ΓN,
which is a typical decay law of exponential (or nuclear)
decay. The spatial component of (43) allows us to evaluate the acceleration A since
ρA − zaI

, (45)
where vi
is the initial (or the injection or kick) velocity
of the particles of the second fluid with respect to the
decaying fluid. In practice vi
is the average velocity of the
‘injected’ particles. Therefore, this model contains two
parameters: the decay rate Γ and and injection velocity
vi
.
Investigations of self-gravitating halos of nearlydegenerate, non-relativistic DDM have produced observational constraints that rule out the combination of
decay lifetimes Γ < H−1
0 Gyr and injection velocities
of vi > 20 km/s [27]. Analysis of the observed massconcentration and cluster mass function has constrained
the DDM parameter-space of decay lifetimes and kick velocities for numerical simulations of DDM, suggesting an
allowed region of lifetimes from a few times longer than
the age of the universe to less than 100H
−1
0
and kick velocities 1 km/s < vk < 100 km/s, [63]. Other indirect
constraints on the parameters of generic DDM models
have been developed via the luminosity distance of supernovae standard candles which has a cosmological and
energy-density dependence, [64]. These results suggest
that in the case that 90% of the mass is transferred to
the massive daughter particle, the decay lifetime has a
lower limit of 8.4 Gyr with 95% confidence. Alternatively, when 15% is transferred, the lower limit on the
lifetime is 25 Gyr, [21]. Other observational constraints
on DDM models have been studied in the literature by
means such as cosmological weak lensing effects [65] or
the influence on reionisation via photons emitted during
the decay process [66]. In view of this preceding research,
we propose to investigate a range of decay parameters
within similar regions. We investigate the region of parameter space relating to decay lifetimes of between one
and a few times the age of the universe, and small nonrelativistic injection velocities.
III. RESULTS
Starting from the initial conditions outlined above, the
governing system of propagation equations, (17) – (21),
was time-marched forward to the present day, z = 0. The
results of the evolution of the S-type void is presented in
Fig. 1 and the R-type void in Fig. 2. The density profiles
shown in these figures are normalised by the present day
background density given by eq. (30). Figure 1 illustrates
the evolution of the S-type void over a range of decayrates Γ and injection velocities vi
. Overlaid in each plot
as a red dashed line are the results of the evolution of
the density profile without decay, Γ = 0, and thus no
non-comoving second fluid nor effective heat/momentum
flow (i.e. such a model reduces to the LTB model).
The results summarised in Fig. 1 indicate that the heat
flow associated with the decay leads to a formation of a
new feature within a void. This structure may be interpreted as an additional ditch-like underdensity adjacent
to the edge of the void. The formation of this secondary
structure can occur either in the case of a short decay
rate (i.e. the decay starts earlier in the past) and low
injection velocity or, alternatively, with a longer decay

FIG. 5. Evolution of density profile for S-void at different redshift and for different values of the decay rate Γ. Top panels show
the void without the feature present, while bottom panels show voids with the feature present, thus allowing to link the lowest
redshift where no feature is present with the properties of dark matter. Due to the degeneracy between Γ and vi in order to use
observations of voids at different redshifts to constrain the decay rate a further information about vi (or equivalently particle
mass ratio and energy released at the decay) is required.
rate (i.e. decay starts at a later stage of evolution) and
larger injection velocity. This is due to the fact that
there is an interplay between the two parameters Γ and
vi wherein the decrease in one may be compensated by
the increase of the other. This degeneracy follows from
eq. (45), which shows that the two parameters are both
encapsulated in the effect of the scalar acceleration term.
A selection of total density profiles is displayed in Figure 2 for an uncompensated R-type profile and various
parameters. In the case of the R-type voids, apart from
a very slight shallowing of the centre (in comparison to
the case without decay), there is no apparent impact on
the mass distribution inside the void. The reason why
R-type voids do not exhibit distinctive features is related
to the fact the dark matter decays effects are secondorder, which is more clearly evident in Fig. 3 and 4.
Initially (at the CMB instant), the models considered in
this paper, are very close to the FLRW model, the evolution of which is driven by density and the expansion
rate only (cf. Sec. II C). Cosmic voids are formed due to

the growth of perturbations imposed on the FLRW background [67–69]. Perturbations in the expansion rate and
density are first-order whereas, as seen from eqs. (17)
– (21), both shear Σ and Weyl curvature W are clearly
second-order. Figures 3 and 4 show the present day form
of the expansion rate, shear, and Weyl curvature. The
expansion rate is expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter H = Θ/3. For both types of voids (S-type and
R-type) the perturbation in the expansion rate is large
but still very similar to the LTB case (i.e. the inhomogeneous model but without presence of heat flux). However, the largest difference between these models is seen
in the plots of shear Σ and Weyl curvature W. In the
case of the S-type models the shear Σ and Weyl curvature W are clearly distinct and large. In contrast, while
for the R-type models the shear Σ and Weyl curvature
W are distinct from the LTB case they are now small, so
their contribution to the evolution of the system is slight.
The results presented in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that the
existence of the additional ditch-like underdensity forming next to the edge of the void is a second-order effect
associated with decay-related heat flux. The process of
forming this substructure is dynamical and interrelated:
as seen from eqs. (17) – (21), the density evolution is
affected by the divergence of the heat flux Q, which in
turn is influenced by shear Σ; the shear itself depends on
W, which is a function the divergence of heat flux. Thus
if the gradients are small, the growth of the heat flux and
heat-flux related growth of shear and Weyl is limited –
this is the case of the R-type voids. On the other hand,
in S-type voids the gradients are large and their presence
enhances the growth of the shear and W, and leads to
the formation of the additional ditch-like underdensity.
The extra sub-structure opens new avenues for using
cosmic voids in studies of the physics of DM. Detection
of such a feature would suggest the presence of heat flux

FIG. 7. Reconstruction of a density profile based on the number counts of tracer within a void. The solid line shows the

associated with the decay of DM. In addition, one could
target voids at different redshifts to detect when the secondary structure starts is initiated. Figure 5 shows a
series of snap-shots of the evolution of an S-type density
profile at a few different redshift and different decay rates
Γ. As the models with shorter decay rate develop this
new feature sooner, this structure will be apparent at a
higher redshift. Thus by targeting voids at different redshift one could, in principle, attempt to constrain various
particle properties such as the half-life t1/2 = Γ−1
ln(2),
the average decay injection velocity vi
, or even particle masses. However, the results presented in Figure 5,
should only be treated a proof-of-concept.
First of all, as mentioned above, there is a degeneracy
between the decay rate Γ and injection velocity vi
. Figure
5 shows snapshots for vi = 18 km/s. With a longer decay
rate, one could also obtain the feature at higher redshifts
if the injection velocity is sufficiently large. Thus, without additional constraints on properties of dark matter
particles (such as masses and energy released during the
decay) one may not be able to disentangle constraints on
Γ from vi
.
Secondly, and most importantly, the model considered
in this paper is built on a framework that assumes that
the relative velocity of one fluid with respect to another
is small. This neglects contributions from pressure and
pressure gradients. Thus, the framework breaks once the
velocity of one fluid with respect to another is sufficiently
large.
In the linear regime of small perturbations, the relative velocity of fluids decays. It is only when second-order
effects (such as shear and Weyl curvature) become non-
11
negligible that the relative velocity starts to increase [70].
Note that in the cases considered here, the decay-related
heat flux is sensitive to the injection velocity. If the injection velocity is too large, the growth of the heat flux
enhances the growth of the shear and W, which in turn
leads to a rapid growth of the relative velocity and to a
failure of the framework implemented in this paper. This
phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 6. If the injection velocity is larger than vi = 7.0 km/s the model breaks at
the present day. If the injection velocity is larger then the
model fails earlier. For the examples presented in Fig. 5:
the model with Γ = 0.5H
−1
0
and vi = 18 km/s fails approximately at z = 0.8, while the model with Γ = H
−1
0
and vi = 18 km/s stops at z = 0.4. While the results presented here open a new possibility of testing dark matter physics, i.e. by observing this secondary structure
at certain red-shifts, the framework requires further development in order to quantitatively allow observational
data to constrain properties of dark matter physics.
Such a structure could be observed either directly, by
mapping the galaxy distribution inside cosmic voids, or,
indirectly, by investigating light propagation through cosmic voids. Due to a limited number of galaxies inside
cosmic voids (a few counts per void), it is not possible to
use the galaxy counts within a single void to detect this
structure. Rather, one requires a large number of voids
for stacking the signal. By stacking voids of similar size
and shape, one can increase the number of tracers inside
a “stacked void”. Such a procedure is presented in Fig.
7 which shows an estimate of the (minimal) number of
tracers needed to detect a decrease of number of galaxies
near the edge of a void.
The solid line in Fig. 7 shows the present-day density
profile of an S-type void with Γ = 1/H0, vi = 7 km/s.
This density profile was used to generate a random distribution of tracers within a galaxy. The points represent
the average density obtained by taking a ratio of galaxies
N within a given radius-bin to average number of galaxies N¯ (i.e. assuming galaxies are uniformly distributed,
with number density ¯n, the expected number of galaxies
within the radius-bin is N¯ = ¯nV , where V is the volume
of a particular distance-bin). The error bars represent
95% confidence interval which was inferred from Monte
Carlo simulations: using the density profile (solid line)
random number of galaxies within a void was generated;
the density then followed ρ/ρ0 = N/N¯ ; repeating the
process large number of times and excluding lower 2.5%
and upper 2.5% estimates, resulted in the 95% confidence
interval. The required number of tracers for the case presented in Fig. 7 is 1400. So, assuming, 5 galaxies per void
[72, 73], this means that at least approximately 300 voids
of similar size and spherical shape would be required to
detect the decrease in density ∆ = 0.16.
The decrease ∆ depends on the parameters of void and
properties of DDM (such as Γ and vi). The larger the decay rate or the smaller the injection velocity, the smaller
value of ∆, and hence more voids would be required to
detect this feature. This is demonstrated in Fig. 8 which

Colors correspond to a minimal number of voids required to
detect such a feature. We emphasise this should be treated
as a simple estimate obtained using a direct method based
on the number counts of galaxies within cosmic voids. This
was done by stacking voids of the same size and shape. Given
that real voids are of different size and shape as well as are
subject to intrinsic variations in density profiles, the actual
number of required voids is most likely much higher.
shows that when Γ > 1.05H
−1
0
and vi < 7 km/s the
decrease is lower than ∆ = 0.05 and that requires at
least a few tens of thousand of voids (of similar size and
shape). Given the fact that for larger redshift (for tens of
thousands of voids, one requires higher redshift to probe
a large volume) the amplitude of ∆ is lower this shows
that a direct method of detecting this feature based on
the number counts of galaxies within voids is not effective. For example, the void catalog of SDSS DR12 BOSS1
consists of 10,643 voids [74], discovered between z = 0.2
and 0.7. While impressive, it still seems insufficient to
detect the discussed feature (indeed cf. Fig. 6 in [74]).
A potentially better strategy for detecting this feature
is based on the indirect method of gravitational lensing
[75–77] which could also be combined with the Doppler
lensing method [77–79]. The detectability issue will be
explored in future work.
IV. CONCLUSION
The aim of this paper has been to investigate the effects
of DDM on cosmic voids. We focused on cosmic voids as
they are pristine environments that are less prone to contamination by complex baryonic physics than to dense

environments such as galaxy clusters. By targeting voids
one hopes to disentangle the observational signatures of
dark matter from those of baryonic matter. To this end,
we have developed a novel method of modelling the decay of dark matter. In this model the comoving CDM
component decays into another dark particle with a nonrelativistic velocity, thereby producing a secondary fluid
which has non-comoving average spatial velocity induced
by the velocity of the produced daughter particles. The
effect of this non-comoving secondary fluid on the evolution of cosmological voids has been investigated.
Recent work, [70, 71], has presented thorough analyses
of the effect of non-comoving components upon cosmological and structure formation. The present article has
attempted to further these works by suggesting unstable DDM as a mechanism for producing non-comoving
fluid components. Rather than the non-comoving velocity distribution, we have explored the effect of the DDM
particle parameters on void evolution. The results of this
analysis suggest that for S-type voids there is the formation of a significant secondary substructure induced by
the non-comoving DM component produced via the decay.
With further sophistication, the model proposed and
presented here may offer a contribution towards constraining the unknown particle properties of DM, in conjunction with constraints determined by other means.
Our method could be used to further constrain or discover DDM signatures. For example, if no secondary
substructure is observed than one could rule out combination of decay lifetimes Γ < H−1
0 Gyr and injection
velocities of vi > 10 km/s. Our methods will allow us to
put tighter constraints on DDM. As a preliminary investigation, our goal has been to proffer cosmological voids
as a possible means of indirect detection of DDM, with
no attempts made to constrain DDM particle candidates,
nor to satisfy the possible thermodynamic relations which
would be required for physicality, [80]. The present paper
gives a proof-of-concept that demonstrates that cosmological voids can offer an indirect, observational means
to constrain properties of DM.
