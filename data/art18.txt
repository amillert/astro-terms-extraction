ABSTRACT
K2 was a community-driven NASA mission where all targets were proposed through guest observer programs.
Among those, the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (K2GAP) was devoted to measuring asteroseismic signals
from giant stars to inform studies of the Galaxy, with about 25% of the observed K2 targets being allocated to
this program. Here, we provide an overview of this program. We discuss in detail the target selection procedure
and provide a python code that implements the selection function (github.com/sanjibs/k2gap). Additionally,
we discuss the detection completeness of the asteroseismic parameters νmax and ∆ν. Broadly speaking, the
targets were selected based on 2MASS color J −Ks > 0.5, with finely tuned adjustments for each campaign.
Making use of the selection function we compare the observed distribution of asteroseismic masses to theoretical
predictions. The median asteroseismic mass is higher by about 4% compared to predictions. Additionally, the
number of seismic detections is on average 14% lower than expected. We provide a selection-function-matched
mock catalog of stars based on a synthetic model of the Galaxy for the community to be used in subsequent
analyses of the K2GAP data set (physics.usyd.edu.au/k2gap).

1. INTRODUCTION
The use of asteroseismology to inform studies of the Milky
Way were proposed over a decade ago (Miglio et al. 2009),
when it became possible for the first time to detect oscillations in hundreds, even thousands, of distant stars using
continuous high-cadence, photometric data from space-based
missions; particularly from CoRoT and Kepler (e.g. De Ridder et al. 2009; Stello et al. 2013). However, these early
missions were far from ideal for studying the Galaxy as a
whole, and indeed were never designed with this in mind
(Sharma et al. 2016, 2017). The main reasons were the limited sky coverage and the lack of a well-defined target selection function. A well understood selection function is fundamental if we are to make meaningful comparisons between
observed and synthetic/modeled stellar populations (Sharma
et al. 2011). Such studies play an important role in making
robust inferences about the Galactic stellar populations.
A decade ago, the primary NASA Kepler mission targetted a single field in the Cygnus and Lyra constellations for
four years. In 2014, the compromised satellite was then
re-purposed for a new mission to stare for ∼ 80 days at a
time in different directions along the ecliptic (Figure 1); the
so-called “K2 mission”. K2 was now able to probe stellar
populations in many directions, covering much more of the
Galaxy than achieved in earlier missions. This included the
halo, the bulge, the thin and thick disks, and at vastly different Galactic radii and heights above and below the plane. To
take advantage of this opportunity, the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (K2GAP) was formed around an international
collaboration with the aim of detecting oscillations in thousands of red giants along the ecliptic.
The primary goal was to establish robust stellar ages for
the major Galactic stellar components (Rendle et al. 2019;
Sharma et al. 2019), and to significantly improve on what was
possible with ESA’s Gaia and ground-based spectroscopic
survey data alone (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2019). This was
achieved by devising a well-documented, reproducible target selection to eliminate the limitations of previous spacebased seismic observations, and to maximize the synergy
with Galactic spectroscopic surveys. In total, K2 provided
18 full-length observing campaigns before the fuel ran out
and the spacecraft was retired by the end of 2018. The
K2GAP survey has already published a “proof of concept”
study (Stello et al. 2015) along with a succession of welltested data products. These are Data Release 1 (DR1) containing seismic results from campaign 1 (C1) (Stello et al.
2017), Data Release 2 (DR2) containing seismic results for
C3, C6, and C7 (Zinn et al. 2020), and the final Data Release 3 (DR3) with results from all campaigns in one homogeneous catalog (Zinn et al. 2021). In addition, science

results were published by Rendle et al. (2019), Sharma et al.
(2019, 2020a) and Zinn et al. (2021).
The overarching vision for the K2GAP seismic data was
always that it should be combined with complementary data
from the many other stellar surveys that emerged in the
same decade. In recognition of K2GAP’s potential, several large ground-based, spectroscopic surveys have targetted
K2GAP fields. The surveys with the largest K2GAP overlap
are APOGEE, K2-HERMES, and LAMOST. As we show,
this synergy has proved to be very effective in determining
improved stellar ages for thousands of stars, an important
goal for Galactic archaeology (Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn
2002).
In this paper we report the target selection for each K2
campaign in detail. We discuss detection completeness of
the asteroseismic parameters νmax and ∆ν for the oscillating

of our results for asteroseismic relations and Galactic archaeology.
2. METHOD
2.1. Primary target selection strategy
Our target selection strategy was designed to be easily reproducible, which aids the study of ensembles rather than
individual stars. This is especially important for Galactic archaeology where we need to fit Galactic models to the observational data by taking the target selection into account
(Sharma et al. 2014), but is also useful for exoplanet population studies.
A necessary first step for selecting targets is to have an
input catalog that is well understood, has reliable photometry and covers all regions of the sky that we are interested
in. With this in mind, we adopt the 2MASS all-sky catalog because of its robust photometry and completeness in the
magnitude range we are targeting (9 < VJK < 16). A color
limit of (J − Ks) > 0.5 was adopted throughout the survey.
This was designed to focus on red giants; our primary asteroseismic targets. It can be seen in Figure 2 that most of the
stars for which we can detect oscillations have (J −Ks) > 0.5
and MKs < 1. Stars with (J −Ks) < 0.5 are typically dwarfs
(MKs > 1) that have oscillation frequencies that are too large
to be detected by the 30-minute cadence of K2. A color
limit of (J − Ks) > 0.5 excludes some giants, such as the
blue extension of the red clump stars (the so-called horizontal
branch), which is predominantly metal-poor and are rare.
Although reduced proper motions have been used to separate dwarfs from giants in the past, we avoided it for multiple
reasons. First, it introduces a kinematic bias, which is undesirable for Galactic archaeology. Secondly, the pre-Gaia
proper motions available (UCAC) at the time of the K2GAP
selection, had significant uncertainties. Finally, the dwarfs
that we were not interested in were desirable for exoplanet
studies; and a simple selection function would also benefit
those. In summary, the simplest color based selection criteria
was found to be the best suited for both Galactic archaeology
and exoplanet population studies.
In addition to color, stars were restricted in apparent magnitude (brightness) between a lower and upper limit. The
lower (bright) limit was chosen to avoid overly saturated
stars, while the upper (faint) limit was chosen to avoid observing ensembles with a low yield of oscillating giants. For
the first 3 campaigns (C1, C2, and C3) we used the 2MASS
H magnitude to select in brightness. However, for the later
campaigns, we adopted
VJK = Ks+2.0(J −Ks+0.14)+0.382 exp[(J −Ks−0.2)/0.50],
(1)
which is an approximation of V band magnitude measured
from 2MASS J and K bands. As shown in Sharma et al.
(2018), the formula is accurate to 0.05 dex for stars in 4500 <
Teff/K < 6500. We adopted VJK for the later campaigns because K2 collects data in K p band, which is significantly
bluer than H band. Additionally, spectroscopic surveys like
K2-HERMES (Sharma et al. 2018) and LAMOST that were
following up the K2 targets, observe in the V band.
A bright magnitude limit of VJK > 9 (H > 7 for C1, C2,
and C3) was adopted. However, the faint limit was different

for each campaign, with the typical limit being VJK = 15. The
limit for each campaign was determined by weighing the potential scientific return versus the drop in yield of oscillating
giants when going towards fainter magnitudes. The drop in
yield of oscillating giants when going fainter is due to a couple of reasons. First, in the Galaxy the overall fraction of stars
that are giants for a given apparent magnitude drops as we go
to fainter magnitudes. This is shown in Figure 3. Secondly,
fainter stars have lower signal-to-noise ratio, which hinders
our ability to detect the oscillations. Based on simulations
the incompleteness for the K2 observations was predicted to
set in at around VJK = 14; see Section 3.2.1 for more details.
This prompted us to not propose targets in general that were
too faint.
2.2. Field of view
For certain studies it is important to know the completeness of the observed sample as well as the foot print of the
field of view. The field of view of K2 is 115.64 square degrees comprising a mosaic of 21 CCD modules each made
up of two 1024x2200 pixel CCDs (3.98 arcsec pixel scale)
with slight gaps between the two CCDs and between the 21
modules (see Figure 4). Although the actual area of a module
is 5.507 square degrees, the proposed stars were confined to
5.482 square degrees, most likely due to a CCD-edge buffer
of a few pixels introduced by the python package K2Fov
(Mullally et al. 2016)
1
, which we used to select the targets.
For certain campaigns with high target density, we proposed
stars in 1 degree circles located at the center of selected CCD
modules, to make the spectroscopic followup easier (see Figure 5). Such a circle has a photosensitive area of 2.961 square
degrees (94.251% of the circle’s area), which for this given
size is a maximum possible photosensitive area among all
circle placements.
2.3. Catalog of targets
We provide a master catalog of all targets observed by K2
in the file k2_observed_targets.fits 2
. To construct the catalog we start with a list of epic_ids of observed targets from the Kepler science website 3
. It also contains campaign names campaign, which we convert to an
integer cno. This list includes all targets selected by any of
the K2 programs, not just those proposed by the K2GAP. We
first cross matched it to the epic catalog based on epic_id
and added columns from it. To supplement the photometric
information from 2MASS, we did our own cross match with
2MASS instead of relying on the information provided by
the EPIC catalog (Huber et al. 2016). This was because the
EPIC catalog was missing entries for about 13,000 targets, in
spite of targets being stars (epic_id > 201000000). Moreover, the 2MASS columns mflg and prox were incorrect
for the majority of the stars in the EPIC. These flags, among
others, were used in K2GAP to select stars with good quality
photometry (Table 2). The catalog contains 588,991 targets.
For the rest of the paper we exclusively focus on the 432,830
targets that have epic_id > 201000000; the rest being
non-stellar targets like asteroids, planets, moons and so on.
To the base catalog we have added two additional columns
that provide information about the K2GAP (flag_ga and
flag_sf). Targets that are on the K2GAP target list have
flag_ga=1 of which there are 132,197 in total. This
amounts to 30.5% of all the observed K2 targets. These
stars also include the ‘serendipitous’ ones selected by other
programs that are in the K2GAP target list. We remove the
serendipitous targets to create a K2GAP-chosen sample (referred to as K2GAP complete), following a procedure that
is described in Section 2.5. A majority of the K2GAP complete targets follow a strict color magnitude selection function (101419), and these can be identified with flag_sf=1.

by K2 that are in the K2GAP target list (flag_ga = 1). The fourth column lists stars that are K2GAP complete, meaning it excludes
serendipitous observations of K2GAP targets from other programs. The fifth column lists stars that satisfy a strict color-magnitude selection
function, which is given in the eighth column. The sixth column lists the completeness fraction of stars in the fifth column. The seventh column
lists stars for which we have a νmax measurement in the range 10 to 270 µHz. Finally, the eighth column is the selection function. All stars
effectively have J < 15 due to 2MASS quality cuts.

2.4. Peculiarities of certain campaigns
Due to a late change in roll angle for C3, the actual field
of view was slightly shifted compared to the one provided
by the K2Fov software before observations. This meant that
some of the proposed targets were unobservable. Later, the
permanent failure of one of the CCD modules (marked as 1
in Figure 5) occurring during C10 observations (after C11,
C12, and C13 target selection had been locked in) resulted in
selected stars falling on that module being only partly or not
at all observed for the affected campaigns.
Campaigns C0, C9, C18, and C19 were all unique and they
had very little seismic detections. C0 was conducted as a fulllength engineering test to prove the viability of the K2 mis-

sought. C18 and C19 had light curves of shorter duration.
C18 observations were terminated after 50 days due to low
fuel. About 3000 K2GAP targets were observed but all of
them were found to be serendipitous selections, hence, their
selection function is not known. C19 observations only lasted

marks the row number up to which the sample is complete. For
most campaigns, the completeness is typically high, greater than

while for C12 it is due to extra targets proposed in the broken CCD

fall in the fraction, the cause of which is not clear.
30 days before the spacecraft ran out of fuel. This campaign
also suffered from erratic pointing.
2.5. Proposed targets
We now describe the procedure adopted for creating the
proposed target list. Separate target lists were created for
each campaign. In general, stars were selected to have good
quality photometry as defined in Table 2. Targets in each
list were sorted based on priority. A list of various priority
classes and their order is given in Table 3.
Classes with order less than 10, were for stars known to
be giants from either spectroscopy or asteroseismology or
were special targets. We included stars with existing spectroscopy from surveys such as APOGEE, RAVE, GAIA-ESO
and SEGUE. From previous experience with Kepler, it was
known that seismic detections were possible for 1.9 < logg <
3.5. Given spectrocopic logg have uncertainties of the order
of 0.1 dex, a criterion of logg < 3.8 was adopted for the spectroscopic sample. A lower limit on logg was not adopted as
there are very few stars with logg < 1.9.
Classes with order number greater than or equal to 10, were
for stars selected based on photometry and they make up
most of the proposed sample. The class with order number
10 was used in all campaigns and provided the bulk of the
K2GAP targets. Stars were selected simply based on color
and magnitude and were priority sorted by magnitude. The
class with order number 11 makes use of color
lcolor = −0.436uSDSS + 1.129gSDSS − 0.119rSDSS − 0.574iSDSS +
0.1984, (2)
defined in term of u,g,r and i band SDSS magnitude. The
classes with order numbers 12 and 13, additionally made use

In general, stars were proposed over the entire field of
view (see Section 2.2). However, for certain dense-field campaigns that look into the plane of the Galactic disc, stars were
proposed in one degree circles located at the center of CCD
modules. This was done to make the spectroscopic followup
easier.
The final target list uploaded to the spacecraft for observation was prepared by NASA and it contained targets from
different proposals. Hence, some of our proposed targets
were serendipitous selections; their selection was based on
other proposals and they just happened to also be on our target list. The serendipitous targets therefore do not follow our
proposed priority order. Guided by Figure 6 we devised the
procedure to exclude these targets. Figure 6 shows the average fraction of stars selected from our list as a function of
our list row number. We see that the fraction is high and almost constant for small row numbers, but it abruptly falls to
a low value and remains low for the rest of the list. The sharp
fall in fraction marks the special row number up to which
the sample selection is complete but beyond which there are
serendipitous targets. Identifying the special row number up
to which the sample selection is complete is a change point

where Si
is a binary state variable, which is 1 if the i-th star
is selected but otherwise 0. The procedure identifies the row
number where the completeness f changes from greater than
fc to less than fc. Here, fc is a free tunable parameter and
we set it to 0.8. The actual change point is not too sensitive
to the exact choice of fc. Using the above procedure, a total of 110791 were found to be free of serendipitous targets,
which we refer to as our K2GAP complete sample. From this
sample we identify the 101420 stars that are color magnitude
complete following the selection function listed in Table 1.
2.6. Asteroseismic parameters of giants
In this paper we use two seismic quantities: the frequency
of maximum oscillation power, νmax, and the frequency separation between overtone oscillation modes, ∆ν. The values
we use were the so-called SYD results that are also adopted
by Reyes et al. (submitted) and the K2GAP DR3 catalog
(Zinn et al. 2021). We used the associate detection probabilities pνmax
, based on Hon et al. (2018b) and p∆ν, based
on Reyes et al submitted). A target with p∆ν < 0.5 was assumed to have an invalid ∆ν. A target with both pνmax < 0.5
and p∆ν < 0.5 was assumed to have an invalid νmax. After applying these definitions, a total of 30923 targets had a
valid νmax and of these, a total of 20708 targets had a valid
∆ν. Note, some stars were observed in multiple campaigns,
which means there can be multiple targets (and hence results) that correspond to the same star. To be consistent with
Sharma et al. (2016), we use the SYD results from Stello
et al. (2013) when comparing with Kepler, which had a total
of 12919 targets with valid νmax and ∆ν.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Spatial distribution of oscillating giants
One of the main advantages of the K2 mission over the
Kepler mission is its wider coverage of the Galaxy. This
can be seen in Figure 7, which shows the spatial distribution of oscillating giants in the Galaxy. The K2 giants span a
wide region in the (R,z) plane, while Kepler giants were con-

fined to a small range around R = R. This is specially useful for studying the formation and evolution of the Galaxy.
Away from the plane the radial coverage in R extends all the
way from 2 kpc to 14 kpc (Figure 7b, blue curve). However,
close to the plane the radial extent is quite limited (Figure 7a,
z ∼ 0 kpc). In the heliocentric (x, y) projection the giants can
be seen in all four quadrants, but there are more of them in
the lower half defined by yhelio < 0 (Figure 7c). Although
the giants extend up to a distance of about 6 kpc from the
Sun, most of the stars are within a distance of about 2.5 kpc
(Figure 7d, green curve).
3.1.1. Probability to detect νmax.
For bright stars the K2 mission is expected to detect oscillations in stars with 10 . νmax/µHz . 270. The lower limit
νmax is due to the duration of the observations and the upper
limit is due to the 30 min cadence of the data. The absolute magnitude, for example MKs, increases with increasing
νmax. Hence, stars with νmax measurements should be confined to a range in MKs. This suggests that MKs can be used
to estimate the overall detection probability and this can be
seen in Figure 8, where we plot the ratio of stars with νmax
measurement to the number of observed stars as function of
MKs. The probability in the range −2.5 < MKs < 0 is approximately constant but falls off at either end. Stars with MKs > 0
have νmax that is too high to be measurable while stars with
MKs < −2.5 have νmax that is too low. The average probability in the range −2.5 < MKs < 0 was found to be 0.86 for K2
and 0.89 for Kepler. This represents the overall probability
to detect νmax. The probability for Kepler is slightly higher,
most likely due to higher SNR resulting from light curves
being about 12 times longer. For Kepler the high detection
probability zone extends to lower values of MKs (−3) than for
K2 (−2.5). This is expected due to Kepler light curves being significantly longer than for K2. For K2, we restrict our
analysis to bright stars, 10 <VJK < 13, this is because fainter
stars have low S/N, which progressively makes it harder to
detect νmax, specially for stars with high νmax, which have
lower oscillation amplitudes. Lowering the bright limit on
VJK was found to have no effect on the detection probability
profile shown in Figure 8.
3.1.2. Probability to detect ∆ν for a given νmax.
In Figure 9 we show the probability of detecting ∆ν given
a νmax detection, with each campaign shown separately. The
probability is computed as the fraction of stars with νmax detection that also have a ∆ν detection. The fraction shows
an undulating behaviour with two peaks, which arise from a
global smooth hill shape that peaks at νmax ∼ 60µHz and a
local dip near νmax of 30µHz. For the global shape, the drop
towards lower νmax is due to the lower limit set by the 80 day
duration of the light curve; ∆ν becomes harder to resolve.
The drop towards higher νmax is because νmax approaches the
Nyquist frequency. The dip at νmax ∼ 30µHz corresponds to
the location of the red clump (RC) stars. It shows that ∆ν is
generally harder to detect in clump stars. The asteroseismic
completeness for other pipeline results and as a function of
mass and radius is considered in Zinn et al. (2021).
3.2. Comparing observed asteroseismic data with Galactic
model predictions
One of the main aims of the K2GAP is to study the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. A important step in this
process is to compare the observed asteroseismic data with
the predictions of a current state-of-the-art Galactic model.
This will help identify any major issues that need to be addressed before fine tuning the model. Each K2 campaign was
unique with characteristics such as the light curve duration,
the pointing accuracy, and the crowding varying from campaign to campaign. Hence, it is important to highlight if any

Kepler is shown in panel (ag), while the combined results from all K2 campaigns (except C11) is shown in (ai). The panels in the second and
the fourth columns plot the ratio of observed to predicted oscillating giants in each bin, with the average recovery rate shown in the top right of
each panel. The predictions are based on simulations using Galaxia. The dashed line represents the equation νmax = −60(VJK − 17).The upper
right region (above the dashed line) indicates where we cannot detect oscillations due to too low signal-to-noise.
K2GAP TARGET SELECTION 11
campaigns are in some way problematic. For example, if observations agree with model predictions in some campaigns
but not in others, then that is strong evidence for problematic campaigns. Having described the selection function and
detection completeness we now proceed to performing this
model comparison.
We begin by creating a synthetic catalog of stars in accordance with a Galactic model that satisfy the same selection
function as the observed data, which is available for download 4
. Next, we compare the predicted and observed distribution of various stellar properties, such as apparent magnitude VJK, νmax, and κM; the latter being a seismic mass proxy
that includes both νmax and ∆ν.
To sample data from a prescribed Galactic model we use
the Galaxia5
code (Sharma et al. 2011). It uses a Galactic
model that is initially based on the Besançon model by Robin
et al. (2003) but with some crucial modifications, which are
described in Sharma et al. (2019). One of the most significant
change was the shift in mean effective metallicity of the thick
disc from −0.78 to −0.162. This model with a metal rich thick
disc is hereafter referred to as Galaxia(MR).
The main steps in creating the synthetic catalog are as follows. Using Galaxia, we create magnitude limited samples
with J < 15 for each campaign over a circular area of 8 degree radius. The stars are then filtered in accordance with the
selection function on color, magnitude, and angular coordinates as described in Table 1. We provide a python function6
to do this. Next, the synthetic stars are sub-sampled (without replacement) to match the total number of observed stars
in each campaign that follow the selection function (column
5 in Table 1). In reality, to reduce Poisson noise we oversample the synthetic stars by a factor of 10. For reference
purposes we also show results for the Kepler mission. The
selection function that we adopt for Kepler is given by Equations (2) and (3) of Sharma et al. (2019). Full details to reproduce the Keplerselection function can be found in Sharma
et al. (2016).
The seismic quantities νmax and ∆ν for the synthetic stars
are estimated from effective temperature, Teff, surface gravity, g, and density, ρ, using the following asteroseismic scaling relations (Brown et al. 1991; Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995;
Ulrich 1986).

GYRE (Townsend & Teitler 2013) for stellar models generated with MESA (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013). We used the
code ASFGRID7
(Sharma et al. 2016) that computes the correction factor as a function of metallicity Z, initial mass M,
evolutionary state Estate (pre or post helium ignition), Teff, and
logg. A random scatter based on the median observed uncertainty for each campaign is added to estimated values of νmax
and ∆ν.
As discussed earlier in Section 3.1.1, we expect to detect
oscillations only in the range 10 . νmax/µHz . 270. However the probability to measure νmax is not constant over this
range. The oscillation amplitude in general decreases with
νmax and the overall noise in the extracted power spectrum
increases with increasing apparent magnitude. This means
that at fainter magnitudes the high νmax stars are less likely to
show detectable oscillations. To model the seismic detection
probability we follow the scheme presented by Chaplin et al.
(2011) and Campante et al. (2016). The exact procedure that
was adopted is given in Section 3.4 of Sharma et al. (2019).
In short, the oscillation amplitude was estimated based on
stellar luminosity, mass, and temperature. The apparent magnitude was used to compute the instrumental photon-limited
noise in the power spectrum, which when combined with
granulation noise gave the total noise. The mean oscillation
power and the total noise were then used to derive the probability of detecting oscillations (with less than 1% possibility
of false alarm). Stars with a detection probability of greater
than 0.9 were assumed to be detectable.
3.2.1. The distribution of stars in the (νmax,VJK) plane
Figure 10 shows the distribution of observed stars in the
(VJK,νmax) plane for different K2 campaigns (first and third
columns). Results from Kepler (panel (ag)) and the combination all K2 campaigns (panel (ai)) are also shown. The heat
maps in the second and fourth columns show the number ratio of observed to predicted giants. It can be see that νmax
can be measured for stars as faint as VJK = 16. However, the
efficiency seems to decrease beyond VJK = 16 (dark region in
Figure 10aj). It can be seen that in K2 there is a lack of observed stars in the upper right corner (above the red dashed
line). The red dashed line roughly identifies the threshold beyond which the theory predicts that the oscillations would be
hard to detect because of too low oscillation amplitude (high
νmax) and to high noise (faint stars).
The ratio of observed to predicted number of stars varies
from campaign to campaign, and is typically between 0.66
and 0.89. When averaged over all campaigns the ratio is 0.78.
From Section 3.1.1 (Figure 9) we know that 14% of giants
are expected to be missing. The extra 8% of missing giants
are most likely due to the fact that the model overpredicts the

number of giants (stars with MKs < 2) compared to dwarfs
for stars with J −Ks > 0.5. This needs further investigation.
It could also be due to the turnoff stars being bluer in the
model, and hence getting excluded in our J − Ks > 0.5 cut
used to select the stars.
Campaign C11 has unusually low numbers of observed
stars compared to the prediction, with a ratio of 0.3. This
could be related to the data quality, which is doubtful for a
couple of reasons. Firstly, due to an error in the initial roll angle, a correction was applied 23 days into the campaign and
as a result the campaign was split into two segments. Secondly, C11, which was pointing towards the Galactic bulge,
has the highest stellar density amongst all the campaigns analyzed here. Due to the high stellar density the pipelines used
for extracting light curves as well as for the subsequent asteroseismic analysis are most likely operating outside their
nominal design range. This can severely hamper the quality
of the derived asteroseismic parameters. In the following two
sections we will look at the distributions shown in Figure 10
collapsed onto either axis.
3.2.2. The distribution of apparent magnitude
In Figure 11 we show the distribution of apparent magnitude VJK of the giants with νmax detections, which shows
good agreement between the model and the data. The good
match is primarily a reflection of the fact that the model correctly reproduces the number of giants as a function of magnitude. A good match in VJK is in some sense a necessary
condition before we embark on a more detailed comparison
of model predictions with observations. The number of observed and predicted giants is listed on each panel. It can
be seen that the model overpredicts the number of oscillating
giants, which we discuss in more detail later on.
3.2.3. The distribution of νmax
In Figure 12 we now show the observed distribution of νmax
alongside the model predictions. The distribution shows a
peak at around νmax of 30.5 µHz, corresponding to the RC
stars. For K2, the peak of observed stars is significantly
shallower compared to the prediction. This could be due to
the uncertainty in νmax being underestimated in the model
or because the model is inaccurate. It could also be due to
RC stars preferentially ‘escaping detection’. For K2, the observed peak is systematically shifted to lower νmax compared
to the predictions, except for C4 and C13. Interestingly, both
C4 and C13 point towards the anti-center direction suggesting the model requires some changes.

which essentially is a temperature-independent seismic
proxy for stellar mass. Mass is one of the most useful asteroseismic quantities because it helps us to determine the
stellar age. Hence, comparing the observed distribution of
κM with theoretical models is central to the theme of Galactic archaeology. Here, we begin by studying the distribution
of stars in the (νmax,κM) plane. This plane is also useful to
study the properties of RC and red giant branch (RGB) stars
separately, because as Sharma et al. (2019) showed, it can be
used to segregate RC from RGB stars. The RC stars show a
very sharp edge in this plane; a feature that was used by Li
et al. (2021) to measure the intrinsic scatter of asteroseismic
scaling relations.

model predictions for K2 and Kepler are shown in the second
and fourth rows, respectively. The distributions of RC (middle column) and RGB (right column) stars are also shown
separately. The RGB stars are distributed over a wide range
of νmax and κM. However, RC stars form a diagonal sequence, with most of them lying in a narrow region marked
by the two solid curves. These curves were designed by
Sharma et al. (2019) to segregate the RC from the RGB.
Here, they aid the eye when comparing the distributions in
the different panels. The sharp right edge in the RC distribution is very clear. The over density in the RGB distribution
is due to the RGB-bump stars, and it partly overlaps with the
location of the majority of the RC stars. The distributions for
K2 and Kepler are very similar. However, the RC sequence
is slightly sharper for Kepler, most likely due to more precise
νmax and κM. Overall, the model predictions match well with
the observed distributions. A comparison of panel (b) with
other panels in the middle column shows that K2 has a significant number of stars to the right of the rightmost solid curve,
which is neither predicted by the model (Figure 13e) nor it is
present in the Kepler data (Figure 13h). This suggests that
in K2 some RGB stars are misclassified as RC stars, which
is not unexpected given the K2 observations are relatively
short making the seismic RC/RGB distinction more uncertain (Hon et al. 2018a). The RC stars with high νmax and high
κM are secondary clump stars. The models (Figure 13e,k)
suggest that they have an upper limit of around 100 µHz for
νmax. In Kepler we do see these stars all the way till 100 µHz.
However, the K2 data seems to have relatively fewer of them.
The models also predict a second sequence at low νmax (stars
at the end of helium core burning; the so-called AGB clump
stars), but this is not seen in the data. Finally, in the models, the location of the RGB-bump is offset with respect to
that in observations, with the model’s location being shifted
to lower νmax, which is a known problem of contemporary
stellar evolution models (Silva Aguirre et al. 2020).
3.2.5. The distribution of stars in κM
The distribution of κM is one of the most sensitive tests
of the Galactic models, because it is related to mass, which
in turn is related to age. Hence, the distribution of κM is
effectively the age distribution of the stars. As such, it is
sensitive to the star formation history and radial migration
in the Galaxy. From Sharma et al. (2019) we know that for
a given age, the mass of a star is correlated with its metallicity. Hence, the distribution of κM indirectly also probes
the age metallicity relation. Studies using Kepler showed
that models over predict the number of low κM stars Sharma
et al. (2016). However, doubts about the reproducibility of
the complicated selection function of Kepler, prevented us
from drawing any strong conclusions. This problem was alleviated by K2GAP, because of its simple selection function.
Using data from four K2 campaigns, Sharma et al. (2019)
showed that most of the discrepancy was due to the metallicity of the thick disc being too low in the models. In Figure 14 we repeat the same analysis but now using 16 K2
campaigns. Distributions for high-luminosity RGB (hRGB),
RC, and low-luminosity RGB (lRGB) stars are shown separately. This was done because, for K2 the probability to
detect ∆ν varies with stellar type (Figure 9), suggesting systematic effects for different stellar types. The stars were split
into these categories based on their location in the (νmax,κM)
plane (see Figure 13); hRGB (left of leftmost solid curve),
RC (between the two solid curves) and lRGB (right of right-

most solid curve). Our results confirm the findings of Sharma
et al. (2019). Figure 14 shows that for the lRGB stars the
observed κM distribution is in good agreement with the predictions. The agreement is also good for hRGB stars, but the
models seems to slightly over predict the number of low mass
stars. However, for the RC the models seem to significantly
over predict the number of low mass stars. This can be seen
more clearly in Figure 15 where we combine the results from
all K2 campaigns to boost the sample size. The predicted
distribution from the old Galaxia model, with its very metal
poor thick disc, is also shown for comparison. It cannot even
reproduce the κM distribution for the lRGB stars. A more detailed quantitative comparison is given in Table 4, where we
list the ratio of observed to predicted median κM for different
K2 campaigns, which simply reinforce the qualitative trends
discussed above.
The mismatch between the observed and the predicted distribution for RC stars (Table 4) could be due to the model
being inaccurate. For example, inaccuracies in the Galactic
model (or underlying stellar models) or inaccuracies in predicting the asteroseismic parameters for the modelled sample. However, given that K2 fails to measure ∆ν for a significant number of RC stars (Figure 9), it is possible that low
mass stars preferentially evade ∆ν measurement. There is
some circumstantial evidence to support this. For Kepler we
do not have any ∆ν incompleteness and we also do not see
any discrepancy with model predictions.
4. ASTEROSEISMIC SCALING RELATIONS AND
GALACTIC ARCHAEOLOGY
Asteroseismology can provide ages for giant stars and
hence is a promising tool for studying Galactic structure and
evolution. However, it has proven to be difficult to check the
accuracy of the ages and masses estimated by asteroseismology, due to the shortage of independent estimates of mass and
age. Earlier studies indicated that asteroseismology overestimated masses, found by comparing them with the expected
mass of metal poor giants in the Kepler sample (Epstein et al.
2014), and dynamical mass measurements of binary systems
(Gaulme et al. 2016). Based on Stello et al. (2009), Sharma
et al. (2016) showed that there are theoretically motivated
corrections to the ∆ν scaling relation, which are important
to take into account. These corrections are enough to resolve
the discrepancy for metal poor giants noticed by Epstein et al.
(2014). However, the situation regrading the eclipsing binaries is more complicated. Gaulme et al. (2016) suggested
15% overestimation of mass in spite of ∆ν corrections, while
the work by Brogaard et al. (2018) suggested a good match
with the dynamical masses for at least some binaries.
Population synthesis-based Galactic models, provide an
indirect way to validate the asteroseismic estimates, assuming that the models are sufficiently accurate. These models have been constructed independently of asteroseismology
and built to satisfy a number of observations, such as photometric star counts, kinematics, and stellar abundances from
spectroscopic surveys. As mentioned in the previous section,
studies using the Kepler mission have revealed that the models predict too many low mass stars compared to the observed
mass distributions, both for giants (Sharma et al. 2016) and
subgiants (Sharma et al. 2017). This raised doubts on the
accuracy of the asteroseismic scaling relations, the Galactic
models, and/or the selection function. Sharma et al. (2019)
revisited this by analyzing asteroseismic data from four campaigns of the K2 mission, which had a well defined selection
function. They showed that if the metallicity distribution in
the Galactic models is updated to match the measurements
from recent spectroscopic surveys, the distribution of asteroseismic masses (for low luminosity giants) is in good agreement with the model predictions. And as mentioned in the
previous section, that result is confirmed here using data from
all K2 campaigns.
A number of new interesting developments have happened
since the analysis by Sharma et al. (2019). Sharma et al.
(2019) updated the metallicity in the Galactic model based
on results from APOGEE-DR14, but in the latest APOGEEDR16 data release the metallicity of thick disc stars is lower
by about -0.06 dex. This will again make the models overpredict the number of low mass stars.
Recent results by Sharma et al. (2021a,b, 2020b) suggest
that the thick disc model adopted by Galaxia is too simplis-

tic. These results suggest that there is no distinct thick disc,
instead the whole disc is considered to be a continuous sequence of stars in age, with no natural boundary between
thick and thin discs. The stellar abundances were shown to be
a function only of stellar age and birth radius with the radial
migration playing a crucial role in moving stars from their
place of birth. The effect of the new model on the distribution of stellar masses is expected to be small, but it still needs
to be tested.
Sharma et al. (2021b) showed that kinematics can be used
to estimate the age of an ensemble of stars and hence test the
asteroseismic scaling relations. They concluded that the asteroseismic ages for Kepler stars is underestimated by at least
10% (or mass overestimated by about 2.6%). However, no
such correction is required for K2. The exact reason for the
systematic difference between Kepler and K2 is not yet clear,
however, it is clear that this systematic is due to the K2 light
curve being significantly shorter. Zinn et al. (2021) demonstrate in their Figure 5 that Kepler data, when shortened to K2
time baselines, leads to an underestimation of νmax by about
1% (hence mass by 3%), which is in good agreement with
findings of Sharma et al. (2021b). This is consistent with our
results for lRGB stars as shown in Table 4, which shows that
for K2, the mass is overestimated by 2.2% while for Kepler it
is 4.1%. In other words, the K2-based masses are about 1.9%
lower than for Kepler. Another interesting systematic associated with asteroseismic mass and age is given by Warfield
et al. (2021), who suggest that the ages of high [α/Fe] stars
are underestimated by stellar models by about 10%, in excellent agreement with Sharma et al. (2021b). Traditionally,
the Salaris & Cassisi (2005) formula is used to account for
[α/Fe] enhancement by assuming solar composition, but increasing the metallicity. Warfield et al. (2021) suggests that
this approach is not sufficient. To conclude, both Kepler
and K2 results (after taking the systematic due to light curve
length into account) suggest that there is a discrepancy of
about 4% between the observed and predicted masses, with
the observed masses being higher.
5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have provided an overview and motivation of the K2GAP Guest Observer program, whose main
aim is to study the Galaxy through asteroseismology of giants. The program was designed to select stars with an easily
reproducible selection function. A total of 132,197 targets
were proposed through K2GAP, accounting for 30.5% of the
stellar targets observed by K2. Amongst these, 101,419 stars
follow a well defined color-magnitude selection. One of the
most important contributions of this work is providing rigorous selection function criteria for each campaign in a tabular
form. A python code implementing the selection function is
also provided. We also provide a catalog of all stars observed
by K2 along with flags to identify stars belonging to our pro-
18 SHARMA ET AL.
gram and stars that strictly satisfy our prescribed selection
criteria. In order to facilitate comparison with predictions
of theoretical Galactic models, we also provide selectionmatched mock catalogs generated using Galaxia. We present
a simple and efficient “change point identification” algorithm
used to screen out K2 stars that were proposed by the K2GAP
but were serendipitously selected by NASA through other
Guest Observer programs.
Our work provides useful guidelines for designing future
astronomy surveys. Quite often we know the targets that we
want based on some property of the targets. However, we
lack decisive data that measures that property. In such cases
it is tempting to design overly sophisticated approaches that
in most cases lead to marginal increase in efficiency of selecting the right targets. We show that in such situations,
if possible, adopting a holistic approach can greatly simplify
the selection function. For K2GAP, we applied a simple color
criteria to focus on the giants. This inevitably led to dwarfs
in our sample, which are not useful for doing asteroseismology with K2’s 30-min cadence. However, recognizing the
fact that they are useful for exoplanet studies, no effort was
made to exclude them. This greatly simplified our selection
function.
We show that asteroseismic giants in K2 span a wide range
of R and |z| in the Galaxy, offering a significant advantage for
Galactic studies compared to Kepler. K2 also contains significantly older stars than Kepler, which are useful to probe
the early history of the Galaxy. However, the wider coverage
comes at the price of light curves having shorter duration,
and consequently lower S/N.
Making use of Gaia parallaxes, we identify giants that are
bright enough to show oscillations with appreciable SNR and
use them to study νmax measurement completeness. We find
that for about 14% of these giants νmax cannot be measured.
The exact cause for this is not known and requires further
investigation. Unlike Kepler, not all stars with νmax measurements have a ∆ν measurement. The probability to detect ∆ν
is maximum at around νmax = 60 µHz and falls off for higher
and lower values of νmax. This is due to lower SNR and frequency resolution of K2 compared to Kepler, which makes
detection of ∆ν harder. Additionally, our results suggest that
it is more difficult to detect ∆ν for a RC star compared to an
RGB star, most likely due to the oscillation power spectra of
RC stars being more complex.
For each campaign, we compare the observed distribution
of various asteroseismic parameters with the predictions of a
Galactic model using Galaxia. Such a comparison is useful to
test the model and theory, but is also useful to check the quality of the data. This is especially important for K2 because
it collected data over various campaigns with each of them
having their unique technical difficulties and challenges over
the full course of the mission. For most campaigns, the observed number of giants with νmax measurements is roughly
in agreement with predictions, with a observed-to-predicted
ratio of stars of 0.78. However, for C11 the ratio is 0.3, which
is exceptionally low. Further investigations suggest that this
could be due to the roll angle error and the shortened light
curve for this particular field.
The distribution of stars in the (νmax,κM) plane shows a
good match with model predictions, both for RGB and RC
stars. However, some differences could also be seen. The
RC sequence in K2 is not as sharp as in Kepler, due to K2
having higher uncertainty in νmax and κM compared to Kepler. The location of the RGB-bump was at a lower νmax in
the models compared to the observations as expected from
shortcomings in stellar evolution models (Silva Aguirre et al.
2020). Some RGB stars were found to be classified as RC in
K2. There also seems to be a lack of secondary RC stars in
K2 observations compared to both the model predictions and
the Kepler results.
We compare the observed κM distribution with those of
model predictions. We find that for low luminosity giants in
K2, the observed median κM is 2.2% higher than predicted.
The observed RC and high luminosity giant distributions differ significantly from predictions. This is most likely due
to significant incompleteness in ∆ν measurements. For low
luminosity Kepler giants the observed median κM is 4.1%
higher than predicted. Hence, in general the K2 masses are
lower by about 1.9% compared to Kepler, which is in agreement with findings of Sharma et al. (2021b) based on stellar kinematics. As discussed in Zinn et al. (2021, see their
Figure 5), this systematic offset is due to the shorter time
baseline of K2 compared to Kepler. Hence, data from both
K2 and Kepler suggest that asteroseismic masses are higher
by about 4% compared to model predictions. Some of this
discrepancy could be due to inaccurate modelling of [α/Fe]
enhanced stars (Warfield et al. 2021), and some of it could be
due inaccuracies in modelling the Galactic disc Sharma et al.
(2021a,b). In future, a further improvement in both the stellar
models and Galactic models is required.
