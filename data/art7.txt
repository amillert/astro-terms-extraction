Bias in apparent dispersion measure due to de-magnification of plasma
lensing on background radio sources
ABSTRACT
The effect of ionized gas on the propagation of radio signals is known as plasma lensing. Unlike gravitational lensing, plasma
lensing causes both magnification and strong de-magnification effects to background sources. We study the cross section of
plasma lensing for two density profiles, the Gaussian and power-law models. In general, the cross section increases with the
density gradient. Radio sources can be used to measure the free electron density along the line of sight. However, plasma lensing
de-magnification causes an underestimate of the electron density. Such a bias increases with the electron density, and can be
up to ∼ 15% in the high density region. There is a large probability that high density clumps will be missed due to this bias.
The magnification of plasma lensing can also change the luminosity function of the background sources. The number density of
sources on both the high and low luminosity ends can be overestimated due to this biasing effect.

1 INTRODUCTION
Propagation of light in the universe can be affected by several phenomena, e.g. gravitational field generated by massive objects. An
example of such phenomena is gravitational lensing, which provides
a powerful tool in studying matter distributions throughout the Universe (e.g. Schneider et al. 2006). In addition to gravitational lensing,
inhomogeneous distributions of free electrons can cause deflection
of light rays as well, called plasma lensing (e.g. Clegg et al. 1998;
Tuntsov et al. 2016; Cordes et al. 2017). Plasma lensing shares several similar features with gravitational lensing, especially in terms
of the mathematical description. However, different features introduced by plasma lensing (such as wavelength dependence) become
significant only at low frequency, e.g. usually in the radio band.
Moreover, the deflection caused by plasma lensing is opposite to the
deflection due to gravitational lensing, which makes an over-dense
clump of plasma to act as a diverging lens. Observations of plasma
lensing began with the discovery of wild changes in the flux density of compact radio sources (Fiedler et al. 1987), a phenomenon
known as Extreme Scattering Events (ESEs). Although a detailed
physical picture of the phenomenon remains elusive, it is believed
that wavelength-dependent refraction due to plasma along the line of
sight in an ESE cannot be neglected. Since the introduction of the
Gaussian plasma lens model, it has been widely used to describe the
phenomenon (Romani et al. 1987; Clegg et al. 1998).
Millisecond duration pulses, known as fast radio bursts

(Lorimer et al. 2007; Cordes & Chatterjee 2019; Petroff et al. 2019),
are dispersed during propagating in the ionised gas of the interstellar and intergalactic media. Several observational aspects of FRBs
are modulated by plasma lensing, such as the dispersion relation
and amplitude. The cosmological origin of FRBs provide a potential
probe to study the total integrated column density of free electrons
along the line of sight. Studies of the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium using FRBs with redshift have been recently introduced in the literature (e.g. Macquart et al. 2020; James et al. 2021).
However, the frequency-time delay relation (i.e. the Dispersion Measure, DM), is not an exact estimate of the projected electron density
(e.g. Kulkarni 2020; Er et al. 2020; Ocker et al. 2021). Moreover,
it has been noted that plasma lensing is responsible for both magnification and strong de-magnification of background sources from
both observations (e.g. Clegg et al. 1998) and analytical models (e.g.
Tuntsov et al. 2016; Er & Rogers 2018). The diverging properties
of plasma lensing deflects radio signals that would otherwise be
received by us without a plasma clump along the line of sight. Therefore, the probability of detecting background sources is modified by
the existence of plasma lenses. The distribution of the observed background sources will not be uniform, and will always appear biased
toward the low density region of the plasma clumps. With such a biased tracer, one expects another systematic error in the estimation of
the electron density in addition to all the other uncertainties already
mentioned. In this study, we perform a toy simulation to evaluate
the effect of such a systematic density bias, neglecting all the other
uncertainties. We briefly summarise the basics of plasma lensing in

estimating the electron density is presented in Sect. 4. Finally we
discuss our results in Sect. 5. We adopt the standard ΛCDM cosmology with parameters based on the results from the Planck 2018
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2020): ΩΛ = 0.6847, Ω푚 = 0.315, and
Hubble constant 퐻0 = 100ℎ km s−1 Mpc−1 with ℎ = 0.674.
2 THE BASICS OF PLASMA LENSING
The description of plasma lensing follows from gravitational lensing,
e.g. Schneider et al. (2006). One can also find details from, e.g.,
Tuntsov et al. (2016); Cordes et al. (2017); Er & Rogers (2018). The
lens is approximated as thin and the deflection angles are assumed
to be small. We consider a source at angular position 훽 on the source
plane with respect to the line of sight. The corresponding image of
this source is then formed at the angular position 휃 on the observer’s
sky. For simplicity we only consider axisymmetric lens models. The
lens equation can be thus related by the deflection angle 훼
훽 = 휃 − 훼(휃) = 휃 − ∇휃휓(휃), 휃 =

where 휓 is the effective lens potential, and ∇휃 is the gradient on the
image plane. In plasma lensing, the effective potential is determined
by the projected electron density 푁e (휃), and is given by
휓(휃) ≡ 퐷푑푠
퐷푑퐷푠
휆

2휋
푟푒 푁e (휃), (2)
where 퐷푑푠 , 퐷푑, and 퐷푠 are the angular diameter distance from
lens to source, from lens to observer, and from observer to source
respectively. 푟푒 is the classical electron radius, and the wavelength
of the signal is 휆. In principle, the observed wavelength is redshifted
due to the expansion of the universe, i.e. 휆
obs = (1 + 푧)휆. Since we
only consider lenses at low redshifts, such an effect is tiny and will
be neglected. In this work, we mainly focus on point-like sources,
such as pulsars or FRBs. Due to the weakness of the lensing effects,
image distortions cannot be observed directly. Moreover, the phases
of radio signals are not included in the current study, which may
affect observations of coherent sources. Thus, the magnification and
frequency-dependent time-delay are the main observables. Plasma
lensing usually produces behaviour analogous to a diverging lens,
and causes significant de-magnification, i.e. |휇| ≪ 1. Magnification
can be calculated from the Jacobian 퐴 of the lens equation (1), such
that 휇
−1 = det(A). In the axi-symmetric lens, the magnification
simplifies,

Two analytical toy models are adopted to describe the number
density of electrons. The first is the widely used Gaussian model
(e.g. Clegg et al. 1998; Cordes et al. 2017), which can also serve as
a building block for constructing more complicated density profiles.
The second profile we consider is a power-law model, of which the
lensing properties can be calculated analytically as well. Moreover,
the maximum density gradient of the power-law lens model, which
depends on the power-law index, can be much higher than that of a
Gaussian profile even with a low average density. It is thus interesting
to explore both profiles as they can be adopted for different scenarios.
A Gaussian random field model provides a good description of the
Kolmogorov spectrum of electron densities (e.g. Cordes et al. 2016),
which will be studied in a future work.
2.1 Magnification profiles
2.1.1 A Gaussian model
Let us first consider a Gaussian model centred at the origin of the
coordinate system as our example lens. The electron column density

with 푁0 the maximum electron column density within the lens and

at 휃 = 휎, which is given by

We see from Eq. 8 that the lensing properties of the Gaussian, such
as the magnification and number of critical curves, depend on the
ratio 휃0/휎. For example, multiple images and caustics appear when
휃0 > 휃crit, where 휃crit =
p
e
3/2/2휎 ≈ 1.5휎 (Er & Rogers 2018).
We evaluate the ratio 휃0/휎, and in Fig. 1 show the image-source
positions, as well as the magnification curves on the image and
source planes, respectively. The image and source coordinates are
normalised by the lens width 휎. In the left panel, peaks and valleys
of all the curves appear at similar image positions, and they all
approach the identity 훽 = 휃 after about 휃 = 4휎. That gives similar
radial positions for the critical curves, where the magnification curves
of super-critical lenses peak around ∼ 휎 and 3휎 (middle panel). In
the right panel, the magnification as a function of the source position
is shown. In the region where the curve corresponds to more than
one magnification, multiple imaging occurs, e.g. in the pink shade
region, three images are generated by the red curve lens.
For a super critical lens (i.e. more than one caustic is generated
by the lens), inside the inner caustic, only one image is formed by
the lens with extremely de-magnification (휇 ≪ 1). Thus once a
source is located inside the inner caustic, we have low probability to
detect any signal, and we call this region as “forbidden”. As 휃0/휎
increases, the inner caustic (which indicates the forbidden region)
slowly moves outwards. In contrast, the position of the outer caustic
moves outwards more rapidly, and the area between the two caustics
grows. However, this does not have strong significance, because at
large radii, the magnifications of the first image is close to unity,
and those of the second and third images are extremely small (i.e. the
images are strongly de-magnified and have a low probability of being
observed). One can see this from the magnification curves in the pink
shaded region in Fig. 1. In fact, the possible positions to detect two
images is around the inner caustic, where the second image is only
slightly de-magnified.

where ℎ > 0, and 푛0 is a constant that represents the electron

The electron density of the power-law model becomes infinite at the
centre of the lens. In order to avoid this shortcoming, a finite core can
be included in the density profile, with angular core radius 휃푐. Then
one can simply add the core size in quadrature in the usual expression
for the radius 휃 −→ q

More details on the Softened Power-Law (SPL) plasma lensing model
can be found in e.g. Er & Rogers (2018); Rogers & Er (2019). The
power-law density profiles usually have a higher density gradient
than the Gaussian profile, and the density gradient increases with
the power index. We adopt the profile with ℎ = 2 in our study. The

lensing of the SPL model in Fig. 2. The forbidden region increases
with 휃0/휃푐 as well. However, the similarities between the models
end here. In fact the SPL lens shows several significant differences
from the Gaussian lens. For power-law lenses, the deflection curves
approach the identity 휃 = 훽 at different speeds after the first peak,
which depends on the 휃0/휃푐 ratio. On the image plane, the position
of the first critical curve is close to ∼ 휃푐, while the position of
the second critical curve increases constantly with 휃0/휃푐. The most
important difference is that the forbidden region on the sourc

can increase to a large area, and we do not find an upper limit with
larger 휃0/휃푐 in additional tests.
2.1.3 A simple comparison between two profiles
The two density profiles have different properties and parameters. In
order to compare the two profiles fairly, two conditions are adopted
on the projected density and density gradient, namely, the central
density and the maximum gradient of these two profiles are kept
the same (using Eqs. 6 and 13, and Eqs. 5 and 14). With these two
constraints, one can obtain

With such constraints, the density profiles can be compared less
arbitrarily. However, as we will see later that the lensing strength
generated by the two profiles are dramatically different. In the caption
of Figs. 1 and 2, the converted parameter ratios are given. One can
see that the corresponding SPL lens will have similar lensing strength
with the Gaussian lenses.

cross section of the two effects. In plasma lensing, the weak deflection
causes tiny separations between multiple images. There is only some
evidence of resolved multiple images from observations with high
resolution, (e.g. Backer et al. 2000; Brisken et al. 2010). We thus
calculate the total magnification 휇푇 on the source plane, which is
given by the sum of all the image magnifications produced by the
lens
휇푇 =
Õ
푖
|휇푖
|, (19)
where 푖 is the index of a particular image. Such a total magnification
does not contain the phase information of the images, and thus may
give slightly different estimates for coherent sources. We define the
area of magnification (휇푇 > 1.05) or de-magnification (휇푇 < 0.95)
region on the source plane as, 퐴mag and 퐴demag.
First, we present the magnification curves for the Gaussian and SPL
models with different ratios in Fig. 3. As we see, the parameter ratio
(휃0/휎 for Gaussian lens, and 휃0/휃푐 for SPL lens) fully determines
the magnification properties of the lens. And it is the same to the
lensing cross section. For both profiles, the de-magnifications of the
sub-critical lenses are mild. Once they become critical, they can
generate a clear forbidden region. The cross section of magnification
increases with the ratio and is mainly between the two caust
magnification bias 5
In Fig. 4, we show the lensing cross section as a function of the
parameter ratio. For the Gaussian model, the rate of increase of the
de-magnification becomes slightly slower after 휃crit, while for a SPL
model, such a change does not appear. The magnification curve is
somewhat complicated. A small transition appears at 휃crit as well. The
dramatic change appears after 휃0/휎 ∼ 2.1, where the outer caustic
moves outward rapidly. When the ratio becomes sufficiently large, i.e.
휃0/휎 ∼ 3.7, the probability of magnification decreases. The reason
is that in some area between the two peaks, the magnification is below
1.05 and will be excluded, e.g. see the red curve in Fig. 3. However,
for a lens with high 휃0/휎, the high probability of magnification
does not suggest lensing strength as one can see that most of the
magnification in the cross section is only slightly larger than unity.
For the SPL lens, the probability of both effects is similar as that
of Gaussian lens, i.e. increases with the ratio as well. The slope of
magnification curve is larger between 휃0/휃푐 ∼ [2.6, 3.1]. After that,
there is a small decrease. It is the same as that for the Gaussian model,
in some area between the two peaks, the magnification is below 1.05.
In order to compare the lensing efficiency of the two profiles, we
show the corresponding parameter ratios of the other profile using
Eq. 18 at the top x-axis in each panel of Fig. 4.
4 MAGNIFICATION EFFECTS
It has been proposed to use radio pulsing sources to trace the ionised
baryons throughout the universe. The relation of the Dispersion Measure to electron density, however, relies on several assumptions and
approximations (e.g. Kulkarni 2020). For example, the contribution
from ions is not included; the temperature of the plasma is assumed
to be low, and the effect of magnetic field in plasma is not taken
into account. Moreover, it is necessary to assume a uniform spatial
distribution of the background radio sources. In gravitational lensing, the cosmic magnification effect can be used to study the matter
distribution on large scales, but the inhomogeneous distribution of
background sources has to be taken into account, (e.g. Zhang & Pen
2005). A significant difference of plasma lensing is that it can cause
strong de-magnification to the source (even for the brightest primary
image), which therefore cannot be observed at all. Thus, the information we extract from observations of radio sources will be in principle
incomplete, a distinct conclusion compared to gravitational lensing.
Such a “selection effect” can lead to a systematic bias in the estimate
of the electron density.
We perform a toy simulation to evaluate the magnification effect
of plasma lensing. For simplicity, we adopt the redshift of a repeating
FRB (푧푠 ≈ 0.2, Spitler et al. 2016) for all of our sources. Additionally, we place all the plasma clumps in the Milky Way in order to
avoid the redshift effect to the estimate of electron density (Ioka 2003;
Inoue 2004). The observation frequency we adopted is 휈 = 1 GHz.
A realistic model of the electron density on small scales is difficult
to obtain, either from observations or simulations. We thus adopt a
simple model and restrict the electron density in the range consistent
with observations (e.g. Cordes & Lazio 2002, 2003; Yao et al. 2017).
An axisymmetric Gaussian density model is used for all the plasma
clumps in the tests in which 푛푙
lenses are randomly and uniformly
placed in a field of 1 × 1 arcmin2
. The lens width 휎 follows a lognormal distribution. The central density of the lens is sampled by
two constraints: i) for each 휎 the ratio 휃0/휎 follows a log-normal
distribution, the mean value of the distribution is 0.05 if 휎 is greater
than 1 arcsec, and is 0.25 if 휎 is smaller than 1 arcsec, ii) 휃0 < 1
arcsec to avoid an extremely large electron density (the corresponding
푁0 is about 2600 pc cm−3
).
In Fig. 5, we present the distributions of 푁0, 휎 and 휃0/휎 of our
mock lens samples. Most of the lenses have small density and size.
We calculate the magnification analytically or using finite difference.
The plasma lens potential is calculated from the stacked electron
density of all the lenses on a mesh with resolution of 0.24 arcsec.
The lensing properties, such as magnification can be performed by
using the method in Bradač et al. (2005). We regard the region where
휇 < 0.25 as “unobservable” on the lens plane, i.e. the deflection
caused by the lens is not taken into account. The threshold of being
unobservable depends on the condition of observations. In reality,
휇 ∼ 0.25 is only a rough estimate of the forbidden regions. One
can see from the figures of magnification curves (Fig. 3) that once
the lens becomes critical, the magnification inside the caustic is
extremely small around the lens centre. We also perform additional
tests to calculate regions for 휇 < 0.1. The area of the unobservable
regions decrease by only 10 − 20%, which is mainly caused by the
sub-critical lenses. This will not change our conclusions substantially,
but warrants a more detailed study with observational constraints in
the future.
We mask out the unobservable regions on the lens plane, and
obtain results to compare with those using all the simulated data. In
Fig. 6, we present one example of the density map of 푁e. One is the
initial simulated map of the electron density, the other is the map
we mark out the exclusion regions, which is shown by red colour.
Most of the exclusion regions are located at high density region. But
not all the high density regions are strongly de-magnified, since the
gradient of density is another important factor as well.
We compare the average electron density over the whole field
(label as true) and over the field without the exclusion regions (label
as estimated). 500 realisations are simulated to show the difference
in Fig. 7. The distributions with or without the exclusion regions
show difference, which becomes significant with the increase of the
number of lenses. With a higher electron density, the cross section
of the exclusion region grows, and the probability of detecting a
lower electron density becomes greater. We perform comparisons
for different number of lenses 푛푙
. A probability of a background
source falling in the exclusion region is defined as
휏 = 퐴ex/퐴tot, (20)
where 퐴ex is the area of the exclusion region, and 퐴tot is the total
field area. The probability increases from 휏 = 5% for 푛푙 = 700, to
11% for 푛푙 = 1500 in our tests. Moreover, we calculate the mean of
average electron density over 500 realisations, and compare the true
value with the estimated one by the relative ratio
푟 ≡ (푁¯
e,est − 푁¯
e,true)/푁¯
e,true . (21)
We show the relative difference in Table 1. From both Fig. 7 and
Table 1, one can see that the “estimated” density from mock observations will be lower than the “real” one. With an increase in the
electron density (i.e., the number of lenses in front of the field), the
underestimate becomes larger. As one expects that the density gradient is another important aspect, we perform additional simulations
with higher gradient (the mean value of 휃0/휎 changes to 0.05, 0.5
of the two log-normal distributions in the simulation, and the distribution of 휃0/휎 is shown by the red curve in Fig. 5). The comparison
is presented by the bottom three rows in Table. 1. The underestimate
becomes slightly stronger with the similar electron density. In Fig. 8,
we present 푟 of 푁¯
e, 푟 is estimated by the average and the error bars
present the standard deviation over 500 realisations. As a comparison, we show a linear relation between 푟 and 푁¯
e by the red curve

the deflection caused by plasma is relatively small, we neglect
the spatial concentration by plasma lensing. The same Gaussian
lens populations as in the previous section are used in this example. We randomly sample 5000 sources uniformly over the field
and follow the luminosity function which is adopted from FRBcat1
and the CHIME/FRB catalogue (Petroff et al. 2016, 2017;
The CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021). The observed luminosity of the source is simply calculated by 퐿obs = 퐿ini휇. We compare the initial and observed luminosity functions in Fig. 9. Those
sources de-magnified by the lenses with luminosity below the minimum initial luminosity will be discarded as unobservable sources
(∼ 0.1 − 0.5% for 700 lenses, 푁¯
e ∼ 800 pc cm−3
.). The observed
luminosity will have a wider range of minimum and maximum luminosity. One can see that most of the high flux sources are lensed.

5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS
Inhomogeneous distributions of plasma can deflect the propagation of
low-frequency radio signals, similar to the gravitational lensing phenomena. This plasma lensing shares several similarities with gravitational lensing, especially in terms of the mathematical description.
However, for an over-dense clump of plasma, it behaves analogously
to a concave lens. The plasma lens thus diverges the light of background sources and produces significant de-magnification. We study
the de-magnifying properties, and the cross section for two density
profiles: the Gaussian model and the softened power-law model.
The properties of the magnification and de-magnification of Gaussian plasma lenses can be determined by the ratio of lens parameters
휃0/휎. The cross sections of magnifications increase with this ratio.
Softened power-law lenses can be described by 휃0/휃푐, and its cross
sections increase with ratio as well. Since plasma lensing causes
a strong de-magnification, i.e. 휇 → 0, there will be two observational consequences: 1) the luminosity function of the background
sources is modified by plasma lensing. 2) in the study of using distant radio sources to trace the distribution of electron density in the
universe, there is a bias: when the electron density is high and has
a large gradient, we cannot receive any radio signal. Therefore, the
average electron density that we estimate will always be lower than
their true mean value. We use a toy model in a small field of view
(1 × 1 arcmin2
), a reasonable electron density range from observations (Yao et al. 2017), and compare the simulated and the estimated
electron density. Underestimates are obtained in all our tests. The
magnitude of the bias is correlated with several properties: the number of lenses, the density model, and the density parameter, e.g. 휃0/휎
etc. In general, the higher the electron density, the larger the bias.
From the observed electron density within the Milky Way, e.g. up
to ∼ 2000 pc cm3
along the disk(Yao et al. 2017), the underestimate
can be up to 15% in our test using the Gaussian density model when
the lensing probability is 휏 ≈ 10% (see Eq. 21). We also calculate
the luminosity function after plasma lensing, and find that the distribution of the flux of background sources can be broadened to both
higher and lower values. One interesting point is that most of the
high flux samples are magnified by lensing.
Our study is simplified in several aspects. First of all, the plasma
lensing is frequency dependent. We adopt 휈 = 1 GHz in our study.
In reality, for observations with lower frequency, plasma lensing effects will become even stronger. By comparing observations, e.g.
luminosity function at different frequencies, one can obtain tighter
constraints on both the plasma density and the background sources.
Another two of simplifications are the model of electron density and
the luminosity function of the radio sources. The constraint on the
electron density is weak from observations so far, especially on small
scales. One will be able to rely on high resolution numerical simulations, which have been undergoing rapid improvement in recent
years. Interests in the luminosity function have experienced explosive
growths thanks to the observations of FRBs. We expect that thousands of FRBs will be detected in the coming years. The collective
study of many sources affected by foreground lenses (e.g. by variations in the local electron density or by cosmic re-ionisation) will be
dramatically improved to high precision. Under such conditions the
magnification effect due to plasma lensing will present a systematic
bias and will need to be accounted for.
